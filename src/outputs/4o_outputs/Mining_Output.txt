1) Four Main Areas of Focus for Mining in Africa (2024):

• Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  UN support is helping small-scale miners in places like Jos obtain legal status and meet basic safety and operational standards. Efforts include training on environmentally responsible mining practices and helping miners access formal markets.

• Landmine Action and De-mining in Former Mining Areas (Theme: Security & Humanitarian Assistance)  
  National programs receive technical and logistical support to remove landmines and other explosive remnants in mining regions and conflict-affected zones. Activities also include public awareness campaigns to reduce accidents and rehabilitate cleared areas.

• Governance and Concession Management (Theme: Inclusive Governance)  
  Stakeholders are guided to clarify concession periods, ensure proper licensing, and adopt sustainable development models. This includes building government capacity to uphold transparency, community engagement, and accountability in granting mining rights.

• Combating Illicit Financial Flows Linked to Mining (Theme: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)  
  UN-backed initiatives strengthen the capacity of law enforcement and regulatory bodies to tackle money laundering and illegal resource trading. Training programs focus on criminal asset recovery and improved coordination across borders to address illicit flows from mineral extraction.

2) Potential Challenges or Gaps in Support:

Despite these efforts, inadequate local infrastructure and limited government resources often slow implementation of formalization and anti-mining-hazard activities. Coordination among multiple agencies and across borders can be weak, creating loopholes for illicit financial flows and unregulated operations. In addition, community awareness and social protections (e.g., ensuring safety standards and preventing child labor) may be under-resourced, leaving the most vulnerable populations at risk of harm.
