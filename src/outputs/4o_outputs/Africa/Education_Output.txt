1) Inclusive Access to Quality Education (Theme: Education Access)  
   - Initiatives range from expanding early childhood programs, constructing classrooms, and supporting refugee education, to strengthening primary and secondary school systems. Emphasis is placed on reaching marginalized groups (e.g., out-of-school children, pastoralist communities, refugees) through enrolment campaigns, accelerated learning centers, and child-friendly school interventions.

2) Skills Development for Economic Empowerment (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
   - Programming supports stronger links between formal/non-formal education and employability, with a focus on STEM, vocational training, and entrepreneurial skills. Efforts include youth and women’s skills programs to increase career readiness, as well as sector-wide planning for education-to-employment pathways.

3) Gender Equality and Girls’ Education (Theme: Gender and Inclusive Education)  
   - Projects target the removal of gender-based barriers, including teenage pregnancy, low participation in STEM, and toxic masculinity that hinders girls’ school attendance. Actions include second-chance education, comprehensive sexuality education, and dedicated advocacy to boost budget allocations and policy support for girls’ and women’s education.

4) Mainstreaming Cross-Cutting Issues (Theme: Health & Climate-Responsive Education)  
   - Many actions integrate climate change education, nutrition, WASH, and civic engagement into curricula to reinforce healthy, informed communities. Examples include climate-awareness sessions, nutrition counseling in schools, and civic and human rights education for learners, teachers, and community stakeholders.

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
   - Inadequate budgets and resource mobilization limit the scale and sustainability of education reforms, particularly in remote and crisis-affected areas. Fragmented coordination among multiple ministries and partners can slow progress. Furthermore, persistent gender biases, cultural norms, and data gaps hinder efforts to ensure truly inclusive and comprehensive education coverage.
