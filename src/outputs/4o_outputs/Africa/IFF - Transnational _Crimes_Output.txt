1) Cross-border Trade and Finance (Economic Empowerment):  
   The UN supports raising awareness among cross-border traders on ECOWAS and AfCFTA provisions, including obstacle alert systems for non-tariff measures. This aims to reduce illicit flows and encourage formalized, transparent economic activities along borders.

2) Migration Management and Policy (Social Inclusion and Governance):  
   Programming includes development of inclusive migration policies addressing varied transnational realities (e.g., transhumance, returnee reintegration). By strengthening legal frameworks and coordination, countries can better manage mobility flows and reduce vulnerabilities linked to trafficking or other crimes.

3) Data and Institutional Strengthening (Governance and Accountability):  
   Efforts focus on harmonizing and digitizing administrative data systems to enable real-time, sex-disaggregated data for evidence-based decision-making. Enhanced transparency and oversight of financial and resource flows help detect and prevent illicit transactions.

4) Conflict and Resource Management (Peace and Security):  
   UN interventions support cross-border coordination on natural resource management and the prevention of transboundary disputes. Training and awareness campaigns aim to mitigate criminal activity that can thrive in poorly monitored border regions or contested resource areas.

Key Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited institutional capacities and fragmented data systems hamper effective oversight of cross-border activities. Inconsistent legal frameworks and resource constraints undermine coordinated action. Strengthening regional collaboration and investing in robust monitoring mechanisms remain priorities.
