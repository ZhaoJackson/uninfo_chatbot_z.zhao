1) Four Main Areas of Focus:

• Formalizing Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  Focus: Supporting local miners in places like Jos to register and follow safer practices, improve livelihoods, and comply with regulations.

• Strengthening National Mine-Action Standards (Theme: Peace and Security)  
  Focus: Developing and adopting national policies to address landmines and explosive hazards, ensuring safer communities and more coordinated clearance efforts.

• Enhancing Coordination and Capacity for Mine Risk Reduction (Theme: Governance and Protection)  
  Focus: Establishing or reinforcing mine-action working groups, training stakeholders in mine-risk education, and promoting collaboration among government, UN, and community actors.

• Setting Sustainable Concession Rules (Theme: Policy and Regulatory Frameworks)  
  Focus: Determining appropriate concession periods and development modalities so that resource extraction balances economic gains with environmental and social safeguards.

2) Key Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited resources and uneven technical capacity can hinder effective mine clearance and mining formalization efforts. Coordination difficulties among government agencies, donors, and community groups slow policy enforcement and program roll-out. Finally, maintaining consistent funding and ensuring local ownership remain pressing challenges for long-term impact.
