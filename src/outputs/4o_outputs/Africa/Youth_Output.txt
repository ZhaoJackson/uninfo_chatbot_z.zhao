1. Economic Empowerment and Livelihoods  
   - Focus: Supporting youth in entrepreneurship, agripreneurship, vocational training, and access to financial services. Programs aim to expand job opportunities, enhance marketable skills, and foster an enabling environment for youth-led enterprises.

2. Education Access and Skills Development  
   - Focus: Increasing youth access to formal, non-formal, and technical education. This includes reintegration pathways for out-of-school youth, digital skills initiatives, and support to creative arts and sports programs.

3. Health, SRHR, and Social Services  
   - Focus: Strengthening youth-friendly healthcare and reproductive health services (e.g., HIV, GBV, SRHR policies), with integrated interventions to address adolescentsâ€™ needs. Programs emphasize evidence-based policymaking, advocacy, and capacity-building of health providers.

4. Civic Engagement, Peacebuilding, and Governance  
   - Focus: Engaging youth in oversight of institutions, peace and security forums, and electoral processes. Activities include capacity-building, policy reforms, and collaboration with civil society to ensure meaningful youth participation in decision-making.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite growing efforts, limited funding and coordination often delay implementation, especially in remote or conflict-prone areas. Some programs rely on unstable political contexts and can be disrupted by electoral cycles. Additionally, gaps in data, legal frameworks, or inclusive policies can hinder sustainable impact for youth-driven initiatives.
