1) Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Digital Economic Empowerment (Economic Empowerment):  
  Emphasis on digital financial inclusion (e.g., alternative lending tools, e-wallets), job-matching platforms, and support for women, youth, and entrepreneurs to bolster market access and livelihoods.

• Digital Education & Skills (Education Access):  
  Expansion of e-learning (digitalized curricula, online platforms, e-libraries), vocational digital training, and youth skills development to enhance employability and foster innovation.

• Digital Health Systems (Health Systems):  
  Rollout of digital health information systems (e.g., RMNCAH innovations), telemedicine tools, and capacity building for frontline health services to improve service delivery and data-driven decision-making.

• Digital Governance & Public Service Delivery (Governance & Accountability):  
  Initiatives include e-visa systems, e-justice platforms, and broader digital transformation policies, aiming to modernize public institutions, enhance service accessibility, and strengthen accountability.

2) Key Challenges/Gaps:
Despite progress, connectivity remains uneven across rural and urban areas, limiting reach and impact. Regulatory gaps, data protection concerns, and limited digital literacy hamper broader adoption. Strengthening infrastructure, policy harmonization, and sustained capacity-building are critical to bridge remaining digital divides.
