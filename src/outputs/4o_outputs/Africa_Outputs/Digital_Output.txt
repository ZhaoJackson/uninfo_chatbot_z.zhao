1) Economic Empowerment:  
   • Focus: The UN is supporting digital entrepreneurship, e-commerce, and digital financial inclusion, particularly for marginalized groups (youth, women, and unbanked populations). Efforts range from credit infrastructure for alternative digital lending to the development of digital platforms that link farmers to markets.

2) Education Access:  
   • Focus: Programs promote digitalized curricula and learning platforms at all levels, from preschool to secondary and vocational education. Initiatives include digital libraries, online learning tools, and the expansion of digital public goods to enhance educational opportunities, especially in rural or underserved areas.

3) Health Systems:  
   • Focus: Support for digital health information systems and the institutionalization of proven maternal and child health innovations are cornerstones of UN assistance. This includes procuring digital health equipment (e.g., mobile X-rays) and scaling up digital applications that improve patient tracking, data management, and access to care.

4) Governance and Public Services:  
   • Focus: Digital solutions support public-sector modernization—from e-visa platforms and digitalized court systems to participatory urban planning and anti-corruption feedback mechanisms. By enhancing policymaking and regulatory frameworks, the UN helps governments improve service delivery and citizen engagement through digital tools.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite these efforts, limited digital infrastructure—particularly in rural or remote regions—remains a significant barrier. Digital literacy, data protection and privacy concerns, and uneven regulatory environments also pose ongoing risks. Ensuring inclusive access to digital tools and connectivity, especially for marginalized groups, is critical to closing the digital divide.
