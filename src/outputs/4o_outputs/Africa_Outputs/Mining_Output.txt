1) Four main areas of focus:

• Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASMs)  
  – Theme: Economic Empowerment  
  – Focus: Supporting ASMs in places like Jos to become more organized, regulated, and capable of operating within effective legal frameworks. This includes improving miners’ access to training, finance, and safer working conditions.

• Developing and Adopting National Mine Action Standards  
  – Theme: Peace and Security  
  – Focus: Helping governments establish clear guidelines and procedures for detecting and removing landmines and explosive remnants of war. Emphasis is on ensuring national systems meet international norms to protect communities.

• Community-Based Mine Risk Education  
  – Theme: Protection and Awareness  
  – Focus: Training accredited organizations to educate at-risk communities on safe behaviors around suspected mine areas. These efforts aim to reduce accidents by empowering local populations with the knowledge to avoid unexploded ordnance.

• Coordination of Anti-Mine Working Groups  
  – Theme: Humanitarian Coordination  
  – Focus: Strengthening mechanisms—such as thematic working groups under Protection Clusters—to unify stakeholders and streamline mine clearance and victim support. The goal is to harmonize efforts across agencies and regions.

2) Potential Challenges/Gaps:
While there is progress in formalizing small-scale mining and expanding demining initiatives, funding constraints and limited technical capacity can slow implementation. Coordination among various national and international partners often remains weak, risking overlap or gaps in mine action efforts. In addition, ongoing security issues in certain regions make it difficult to carry out risk education and clearance consistently.
