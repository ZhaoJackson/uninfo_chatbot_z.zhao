Below is a distilled view of four UN-supported “Mining” focus areas in Africa for 2024, drawing on both artisanal mining initiatives and mine-action (landmine) programs, followed by key challenges and gaps:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASMs)
   • Theme: Economic Empowerment 
   • Illustration: In Jos (Nigeria), support focuses on bringing ASMs into the legal framework, training local miners on better extraction practices, and promoting safer, more sustainable livelihoods.

2) Adoption of National Standards for Landmine Clearance
   • Theme: Peace & Security 
   • Illustration: Technical assistance is provided to develop consistent country-wide protocols for mine/ERW (explosive remnants of war) disposal, helping to reduce the threat of unexploded ordnance and foster more stable communities.

3) Strengthening Coordination Mechanisms for Mine-Action Working Groups
   • Theme: Peace & Security 
   • Illustration: Efforts include reinforcing inter-agency groups, improving data-sharing and strategic planning, and aligning resources so that mine-clearance campaigns and victim assistance can operate more effectively in conflict-affected regions.

4) Community-Level Mine Risk Education and Prevention
   • Theme: Community Resilience & Public Safety 
   • Illustration: Accredited organizations are training local leaders and volunteers to raise awareness of landmine risks, encourage safe behaviors, and build grassroots capacity to respond quickly when threats are identified.

Potential Challenges/Gaps
Limited resources and uneven technical capacity often mean only partial coverage for both artisanal mining oversight and mine-action interventions. Persistent security issues and bureaucratic hurdles slow down the pace of formalizing artisanal mining enterprises and clearing landmines. In many locations, community awareness and involvement remain insufficient because of weak local engagement strategies and competing development priorities.
