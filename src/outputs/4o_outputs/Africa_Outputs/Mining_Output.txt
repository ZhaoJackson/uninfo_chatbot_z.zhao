Below is a concise overview of how “Mining” work appears across the 2024 UN Africa programming data, organized into four main areas of focus and followed by key challenges or gaps.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASMs)
   • Theme: Economic Empowerment  
   • Focus: Activities such as “Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASMs) in Jos” strengthen governance frameworks, help miners register and comply with regulations, and improve safety and income generation for local mining communities.

2) Adoption of National Mine-Action Standards
   • Theme: Peace and Security  
   • Focus: Efforts like “Appuyer le développement et l’adoption de normes nationales pour la lutte antimines” promote uniform guidelines for demining, reduce the threat of unexploded ordnance, and protect communities in post-conflict areas.

3) Strengthening Anti-Mine Coordination Mechanisms
   • Theme: Peace and Security  
   • Focus: Through actions such as “Renforcer les mécanismes de coordination à travers le groupe de travail lutte anti mine,” the UN supports inter-agency collaboration, ensures consistent demining approaches, and engages protection clusters to address landmines more effectively.

4) Community-Based Mine Risk Education
   • Theme: Health & Safety  
   • Focus: Initiatives (e.g., “Mettre en œuvre des activités de sensibilisation … pour l’adoption de comportements sûrs”) raise awareness about landmines, educate community members on staying safe in contaminated areas, and work to prevent accidents and injuries related to unexploded munitions.

Potential Challenges or Gaps
Insufficient technical and financial resources, along with limited inter-agency coordination, can slow the formalization of small-scale mining activities and hamper large-scale demining efforts. In some contexts, legal frameworks or mine-action standards are either outdated or not fully enforced. Finally, ongoing insecurity in certain regions makes it difficult to access all contaminated areas and to deliver consistent community-training and risk-education programs.
