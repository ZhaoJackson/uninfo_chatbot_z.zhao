1. Governance, Peacebuilding, and Civic Engagement  
   - Theme: Institutional Accountability and Inclusive Participation  
   - Illustration: UN support fosters active youth participation in electoral processes, peace dialogues, and human rights monitoring, ensuring legislative transparency. It also strengthens youth-led civil society organizations advocating for inclusive governance and security reforms.  

2. Education, Skills, and Vocational Training  
   - Theme: Education Access and Skill-Building  
   - Illustration: Initiatives focus on enabling out-of-school youth to access formal and non-formal education, with vocational and digital skill development that connects them to emerging job markets. Partnerships with governments and local institutions expand youth-friendly learning spaces and curricula.  

3. Economic Empowerment and Entrepreneurship  
   - Theme: Employment Creation and Livelihood Support  
   - Illustration: Programs emphasize strengthening youth agricultural production and “agripreneurship,” as well as supporting youth-led start-ups with financial services and mentorship. Vocational training, marketable skills, and cash-for-work initiatives further enhance school-to-work transitions and decent employment opportunities.  

4. Inclusive Health Services and SRHR  
   - Theme: Health Systems and Rights-Based Advocacy  
   - Illustration: Efforts center on improving youth-friendly health care, integrating SRHR policies, and ensuring adolescents and young people can exercise their health rights. Community-based interventions expand access to essential health and HIV services, promoting self-care approaches and preventing teenage pregnancies.  

Challenges/Gaps: Despite these efforts, many youth still face barriers in accessing funding, reliable data, and stable policy frameworks, making it difficult to sustain income-generating activities. Socio-cultural norms can hamper youth participation in decision-making, and weak coordination across sectors often impedes the effective scale-up of youth-focused programs.
