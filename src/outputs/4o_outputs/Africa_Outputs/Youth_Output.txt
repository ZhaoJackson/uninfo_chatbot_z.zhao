1. Four Main Areas of Focus for Youth in Africa (2024):

• Economic Empowerment:  
  The UN is advancing initiatives such as vocational training, agripreneurship, and financial inclusion to boost youth employment and entrepreneurship. Efforts include “cash for work” schemes, supporting youth-led businesses, and linking young people to value chains in agriculture.

• Education & Skills Development:  
  Programming focuses on expanding both formal and non-formal education, including TVET (technical and vocational education and training) and digital skills. Targeted support addresses out-of-school youth, with initiatives like youth-friendly centres, safe spaces, and mentorship programs.

• Health & Well-Being (including SRHR):  
  Activities strengthen health systems to deliver youth-friendly services, particularly around sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, and GBV response. This includes policy support, integrated service delivery, and adolescent-friendly prevention programs.

• Peacebuilding, Governance & Civic Engagement:  
  The UN supports youth participation in peace processes, elections, and accountability mechanisms. Interventions include training youth peace champions, promoting dialogue through civil society forums, and involving young people in human rights, reconciliation, and security initiatives.

2. Potential Challenges or Gaps:  
Despite strong frameworks, some programs face funding or resource constraints that slow roll-out and scale. Security and political instability in certain regions can hinder youth engagement and program delivery. Limited coordination among government agencies and cultural barriers in remote areas also pose challenges to achieving inclusive, consistent support for all youth.
