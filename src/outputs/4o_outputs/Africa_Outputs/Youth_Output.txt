1) Four Main Areas of Focus:

• Education & Skills Development  
  - Illustration: Efforts include reintegrating out-of-school adolescents into formal and non-formal education pathways, enhancing youth-friendly TVET and vocational programs, and strengthening digital/financial literacy. This extends to providing learning materials and integrating climate change awareness into informal education curricula.

• Economic Empowerment & Employment  
  - Illustration: Programs focus on enhancing school-to-work transitions, promoting youth agripreneurship and entrepreneurship, and supporting local “cash for work” initiatives. They also encourage youth-led start-ups, capacity building for small businesses, and access to financial services.

• Health & Well-Being (Including SRHR)  
  - Illustration: UN-supported initiatives improve youth-friendly health services, with emphasis on sexual and reproductive health (ASRH), HIV prevention, and reducing adolescent pregnancy. There is strong advocacy for evidence-based SRHR policies, ensuring that adolescents and young people can exercise their rights and make informed choices.

• Civic Engagement, Governance & Peacebuilding  
  - Illustration: Youth engagement platforms help young people participate in electoral processes, conflict resolution, and community peacebuilding. Support includes partnering with civil society to increase youth oversight of governance institutions and training youth “peace champions.”

2) Key Challenges or Gaps:  
Despite robust programs, many efforts face delays due to political uncertainties and ongoing conflicts, which can disrupt coordination and funding. Limited institutional capacity, especially for implementing youth-focused policies at decentralized levels, further constrains program reach. Additionally, infrastructure and resource gaps—such as insufficient digital connectivity and youth-friendly facilities—undermine the scalability of initiatives.
