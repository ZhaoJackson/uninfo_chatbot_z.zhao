1) Four Main Areas of Focus:

• Inclusive Basic Education (Theme: Education Access)  
  Illustration: The UN is supporting child-friendly school frameworks, strengthening ministries’ capacity to deliver pre-primary and primary education (even in humanitarian contexts), and expanding accelerated learning programs for out-of-school children. Efforts also include improving infrastructure (e.g., classrooms, WASH facilities) and running enrolment campaigns to increase equitable access.  

• Skills and Youth Empowerment (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  Illustration: Initiatives include developing vocational training, strengthening STEM education, and improving non-formal education to equip young women and men with market-ready skills. There is a strong push to align education with employment needs through sector-wide reforms and capacity-building.  

• Gender Equality in Education (Theme: Gender Mainstreaming)  
  Illustration: Programs focus on increasing girls’ enrollment (including second-chance education), integrating comprehensive sexuality education, and addressing gender-based violence and toxic masculinities. Policies and strategies are developed to encourage and support girls in STEM and to mainstream gender in all levels of education.  

• Integration of Health & Climate Resilience in Education (Theme: Health Systems & Climate Awareness)  
  Illustration: The UN supports ongoing climate change education (e.g., youth engagement in mitigation efforts) and integrates nutrition, WASH, and sexual/reproductive health services into school settings. Training for teachers, health providers, and officials is emphasized to ensure that health and environmental topics are mainstreamed in curricula and school activities.

2) Key Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite the breadth of UN-supported activities, gaps remain in funding, coordination, and systematic policy implementation—particularly in fragile or humanitarian contexts. Gender disparity and limited resources at the local level continue to impede progress, while the integration of cross-cutting areas (like health, nutrition, climate) often lacks consistent follow-through or adequate staffing. Additionally, sustaining institutional reforms and reaching marginalized populations (e.g., refugees, remote communities) demand greater long-term commitment and resource mobilization.
