Below is a concise synthesis of key UN‐supported education priorities in Africa for 2024, based on the extracted program entries:

1) Equitable Access and Quality Education (Theme: Education Access)  
   - Illustration: Efforts include strengthening administrative frameworks to deliver equitable pre‐primary and primary schooling—even in humanitarian settings—alongside building and rehabilitating classrooms, scaling up Child Friendly Schools, and supporting enrolment campaigns to bring out‐of‐school children back into the system.

2) Skills Development for Employment (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
   - Illustration: Programs focus on bridging formal and non‐formal education systems to equip youth and adults with employable skills, expanding vocational/technical training (including STEM), and providing financial education to foster economic diversification and self‐reliance.

3) Gender‐Responsive and Inclusive Education (Theme: Gender Equality)  
   - Illustration: Initiatives emphasize comprehensive sexuality education, policies to prevent teenage pregnancy, and second‐chance education for girls, supported by gender‐mainstreaming strategies (e.g., “Girls in STEM”) and advocacy to remove barriers facing women and girls.

4) Holistic Education for Health, Environment, and Civic Engagement (Theme: Health Systems / Environment)  
   - Illustration: Programs integrate climate change awareness (e.g., informal curricula, workshops for officials and youths), school‐based nutrition and WASH interventions, and civic education to foster democratic participation and community engagement.

Potential Challenges or Gaps:  
Despite these concerted efforts, insufficient funding and infrastructure often limit the scale of implementation (e.g., WASH facilities in schools and teacher training capacities). Cultural norms and policy barriers continue to hinder girls’ and other marginalized groups’ access to education. Additionally, fragmented coordination across ministries, limited data on educational outcomes, and competing national priorities can slow progress in fully operationalizing these initiatives.
