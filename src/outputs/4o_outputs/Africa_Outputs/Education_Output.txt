1) Inclusive and Equitable Access to Education (Education Access)  
   Illustrative Focus: Initiatives include scaling up child-friendly schools, strengthening national capacities for pre-primary and primary education (including humanitarian settings), and ensuring second-chance pathways for out-of-school children, girls, and refugees. Advocacy for higher social-sector budgets and improved sector coordination also features prominently.

2) Skills Development and Economic Empowerment (Economic Empowerment)  
   Illustrative Focus: Efforts concentrate on equipping youth and adults—particularly women—with vocational, technical, and STEM education, as seen in programs supporting employment-driven curricula and accelerated learning centres. There is also a push for better integration of education with market-relevant skills to boost economic diversification.

3) Health-Integrated Education (Health Systems)  
   Illustrative Focus: Comprehensive Sexuality Education, teenage pregnancy prevention, nutrition-sensitive programming in schools, and improved WASH facilities are emphasized to support learners’ wellbeing. Capacity-building for teachers and health workers includes training in SRHR, nutrition counselling, and broader health education to foster safe, inclusive environments.

4) Civic and Climate Education (Civic Participation and Climate Action)  
   Illustrative Focus: Climate change content is integrated into both formal and informal curricula, and civic education programs promote student engagement in democracy and governance. Advocacy and awareness campaigns target gender-responsive climate measures and empower youth and women in decision-making processes.

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited resources and infrastructure hinder the scalability of quality education initiatives, with rural and conflict-affected areas often under-served. Coordination among multiple stakeholders can be fragmented, and sustained funding for targeted groups—like refugees or mobile pastoralists—remains inconsistent. Teacher training, policy alignment, and social norms further pose barriers to equitable education access and outcomes.
