1) Strengthening Cross-Border Trade Governance (Theme: Economic Empowerment).  
   - The UN is supporting awareness-raising for cross-border traders under ECOWAS and AfCFTA, including alert systems for non-tariff barriers. This helps tackle illicit trade by improving transparency and reducing opportunities for smuggling or undeclared flows.

2) Developing and Implementing Inclusive Migration Policies (Theme: Governance and Rule of Law).  
   - Efforts include drafting or updating national migration policies to address diverse realities such as transhumance and return migration. Strengthening these frameworks helps curb illegal migration channels and cross-border criminal activity.

3) Enhancing Data and Monitoring Systems (Theme: Governance and Accountability).  
   - Projects focus on harmonizing administrative data systems, ensuring sex-disaggregated statistics, and using real-time data. Better data collection enables authorities to detect suspicious financial or trade movements and plan targeted interventions.

4) Reinforcing Legal and Institutional Frameworks (Theme: Social Protection and Justice).  
   - Support is provided for drafting legislation, building capacity in governmental agencies, and creating multi-stakeholder mechanisms. These measures aim to address vulnerabilities—such as trafficking or exploitation—that feed transnational crimes and illicit flows.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited coordination between agencies and across borders can impede rapid information exchange and enforcement. Many institutions still lack sufficient technical capacity and resources to fully implement new laws or data systems. Persistent socioeconomic inequalities also create conditions in which illicit economies can thrive.
