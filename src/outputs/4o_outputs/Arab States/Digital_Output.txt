1) Four Main Areas of Focus:

• Digital Governance & Public Administration  
  - Illustration: Government ministries and staff are adopting e-government tools to enhance transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement. This includes training public officials to manage digitalized social protection systems and providing electronic birth registration services.

• Digital Economic Empowerment  
  - Illustration: Investments in digital capacities help smallholder farmers, MSMEs, and young entrepreneurs improve productivity and market access. Projects focus on inclusive financial services, digital trade facilitation, and innovation hubs that spur job creation and green technology adoption.

• Digital Skills & Education Access  
  - Illustration: Initiatives expand youth digital literacy, bridging skills gaps so they can thrive in the gig economy and STEM fields. Targeted training programs equip vulnerable groups with market-ready skills (e.g., coding, entrepreneurship), fostering employment pathways.

• Digital Health & Social Services  
  - Illustration: Digital health platforms (e.g., e-child health books, NCD surveillance systems) improve monitoring and service delivery. Tools for rumor management and social media engagement also enhance public health awareness and community resilience.

Key Challenges/Gaps:
Digital infrastructure, connectivity, and ensuring inclusive access remain ongoing hurdles, especially in rural areas. Gaps in capacity, resources, and regulatory frameworks can slow implementation of e-government and digital economy initiatives. Additionally, uneven digital literacy and limited interoperability across systems complicate seamless service delivery and youth employment potential.
