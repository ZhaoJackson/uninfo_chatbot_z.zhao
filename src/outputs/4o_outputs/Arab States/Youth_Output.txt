1. Four Main Areas of Focus for Youth in Africa (2024):

• Education & Skills Development  
  UN support centers on strengthening technical and vocational education for youth, bridging digital skills gaps, and enhancing inclusive frameworks to prepare young people for emerging labor market needs.  

• Economic Empowerment  
  Programmes emphasize youth-led entrepreneurship, MSME support, and training for innovation and capacity-building, enabling young people—especially those most vulnerable—to access productive jobs and competitive markets.

• Health & Well-Being  
  Initiatives integrate youth-centered health services (including GBV prevention and sexual and reproductive health), ensuring accessible, high-quality support tailored to young people’s unique needs.  

• Civic Engagement & Social Cohesion  
  Efforts include youth volunteering platforms, local peace committees, and community-led projects that nurture active participation, leadership, and conflict prevention roles for youth.

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
While many efforts target youth empowerment, widespread barriers remain in data disaggregation (particularly regarding gender, disability, and age subgroups), the scale of coverage relative to need, and the consistent resourcing of youth-focused programmes. Additionally, bridging policy commitments with on-the-ground implementation often requires stronger coordination and sustained financial support.
