1) The four main areas of focus (2024):

• Area 1: Equitable Education Access (Theme: Access to Education)  
  Illustration: UN support emphasizes inclusive, gender-responsive approaches, particularly for marginalized groups, ensuring quality at all levels—from early childhood to secondary education. Initiatives include nourishing school feeding programs, cash transfers to keep girls in school, and targeted outreach for vulnerable communities.

• Area 2: Teacher Training and Professional Development (Theme: Quality and Inclusive Teaching)  
  Illustration: Capacity-building, standardized midwifery education, and distance-learning partnerships improve teacher skills. These efforts aim to ensure educators can effectively cater to diverse learners, including children with disabilities and those in humanitarian contexts.

• Area 3: Safety and Protection in Education (Theme: Safe Learning Environments)  
  Illustration: Programs target mine-risk education, psychosocial support, and violence prevention in and around schools. This helps create secure spaces and build resilience for students, especially in conflict or crisis-affected areas.

• Area 4: Skills Development and Employment Pathways (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  Illustration: Technical and vocational education (TVET) reform, life skills training, and citizenship education are integrated into curricula for youth. These efforts align learning with labor market needs and promote social cohesion.

2) Key challenges/gaps:  
Limited resources and fragmented coordination frequently slow progress, particularly in conflict-affected or remote areas. Persistent gender and disability disparities require targeted solutions and sustained advocacy. Aligning education outcomes with labor market demands also remains a core gap, highlighting the need for stronger policy frameworks and continuous capacity-building.
