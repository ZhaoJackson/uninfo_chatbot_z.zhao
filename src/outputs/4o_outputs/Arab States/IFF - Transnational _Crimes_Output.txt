1) Enhanced Criminal Justice (Theme: Rule of Law)  
   UN support focuses on specialized skills for investigation and prosecution, including training in forensic analysis and organized crime case management. Efforts also strengthen cross‐border collaboration to tackle human trafficking, cybercrime, and other illicit activities.

2) Legislative & Policy Reforms (Theme: Governance & Institutional Strengthening)  
   Assistance centers on aligning national frameworks with international standards, particularly for the protection of vulnerable groups and the prevention of cybercrime. This includes developing inclusive strategies to address radicalization, violence, and violent extremism.

3) Financial Crime & Corruption Control (Theme: Economic Governance)  
   Capacity building targets the detection, investigation, and prosecution of financial crimes, money laundering, and corruption. Support promotes robust compliance structures and fosters stronger inter‐agency coordination.

4) Community‐Based Prevention & Youth Engagement (Theme: Social Cohesion & Resilience)  
   Programmes like the Strong Families initiative and youth volunteerism campaigns focus on preventing crime, violence, and drug abuse at the community level. These interventions also strengthen social cohesion and reduce risk factors for radicalization.

Potential Challenges or Gaps (2–3 sentences):  
Limited technical resources, especially for advanced investigative work, slow implementation. Legislative reforms may be delayed by governance bottlenecks, hampering alignment with international standards. Furthermore, youth and community‐based initiatives require sustained funding and stronger inter‐sectoral cooperation to ensure long‐term impact.
