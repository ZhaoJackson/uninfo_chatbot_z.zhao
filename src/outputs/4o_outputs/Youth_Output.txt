1) Four Main Areas of Focus for Youth in Africa (2024):

• Education & Skills Development  
  Illustration: UN programs support both formal and non-formal education pathways—such as TVET, vocational training, and reintegration initiatives—to help youth, including out-of-school adolescents, acquire relevant skills, bridging the gap between school and work. They also encourage sports, arts, and culture programs to foster comprehensive learning and personal development.  

• Economic Empowerment & Livelihoods  
  Illustration: Initiatives focus on creating decent work opportunities, agripreneurship, and entrepreneurship training for youth and returnees. Programs such as “cash-for-work,” financial inclusion strategies, and mentorship schemes help young people gain market-driven skills and access to financing for small-scale enterprises.  

• Health & Well-Being  
  Illustration: Efforts center on strengthening youth-friendly healthcare, particularly around SRHR (sexual and reproductive health and rights), HIV prevention, adolescent pregnancy prevention, and mental health support. Capacity-building for healthcare providers ensures that services are equitable, affordable, and responsive to the specific needs of adolescents and youth.  

• Civic Engagement & Governance  
  Illustration: There are concerted actions to promote youth participation in political processes, peacebuilding, and oversight of legislative bodies. Examples include establishing youth peace champions, civic education to enhance electoral participation, and supporting civil society organizations that empower youth voices in policy and governance forums.  

2) Potential Challenges or Gaps in Support:  
While these initiatives are comprehensive, gaps remain around consistent funding, effective coordination among various UN and government entities, and ensuring stable political and security conditions that allow programs to move forward without interruption. There is also a need for stronger data management systems to monitor youth-focused outcomes and continued advocacy for inclusive, youth-centered policies that can withstand changes in political leadership. Finally, limited awareness or buy-in at community levels can hinder the intended impact, underscoring the importance of sustained engagement with local stakeholders.
