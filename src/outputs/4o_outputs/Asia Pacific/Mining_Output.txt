1. Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Clearing Mine-Affected Land (Theme: Peace and Security)  
  UN support focuses on removing landmines and other explosive remnants of war to enable safe land use. This helps communities reclaim land for agriculture, tourism, and essential infrastructure development.  

• Supporting Landmine Survivors and Persons with Disabilities (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  Efforts include providing physical rehabilitation services and livelihood assistance so that survivors can participate fully in society. These initiatives improve social inclusion and economic prospects for individuals and their families.  

• Reducing Mercury Use in Artisanal/Small-Scale Gold Mining (Theme: Environmental Sustainability)  
  Programs center on phasing out mercury in gold extraction through technical solutions and policy reforms. They aim to protect ecosystems and community health while promoting safer mining practices.  

• Strengthening Governance and Regulatory Capacity (Theme: Institutional Capacity Building)  
  Activities involve bolstering national authorities’ ability to oversee mine action and sustainable mining policies. This includes developing stronger legal frameworks and ensuring health, safety, and environmental standards.

2. Key Challenges/Gaps  
Limited financial and technical resources can slow mine clearance and survivor assistance efforts. Coordination across government bodies and partner agencies remains a hurdle to effectively tackle mercury reduction and safe mining. In some areas, weak policy enforcement and insufficient data on mining-related risks create further gaps that hinder comprehensive support and long-term sustainability.
