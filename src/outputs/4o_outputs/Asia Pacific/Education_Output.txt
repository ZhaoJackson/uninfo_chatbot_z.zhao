1) Expanding Equitable Access (Education Access):  
   - Illustration: Initiatives focus on increasing access for out-of-school children, refugees, and vulnerable groups by improving infrastructure (e.g., solar-powered facilities) and offering scholarships, ensuring more children—especially girls—enroll and remain in school.

2) Strengthening Education Systems and Resilience (System Strengthening):  
   - Illustration: Support ranges from enhancing data and evidence-based planning at national and sub-national levels, to bolstering disaster risk reduction strategies in schools so that learning continues during crises.

3) Improving Quality and Inclusiveness (Quality Education):  
   - Illustration: UN agencies work with governments to reform curricula, train teachers on child-centered methods and 21st-century skills, and integrate inclusive practices (e.g., comprehensive sexuality education, support for multilingual learners).

4) Linking Education with Broader Development (Cross-sector Integration):  
   - Illustration: Programs integrate health (e.g., midwifery education, nutrition services) and livelihood training (e.g., community learning centers incorporating living heritage) to ensure education contributes to holistic community development.

Potential Challenges and Gaps:  
Limited funding and coordination hamper large-scale implementation, especially in remote or crisis-affected areas. Data gaps persist, making it difficult to accurately pinpoint needs and track progress. Additionally, varying policy and regulatory environments slow the adoption of inclusive and resilient education models.
