1. Economic Empowerment: Efforts focus on vocational training, entrepreneurship, and access to financial services, enabling marginalized youth to gain marketable skills and launch small businesses. Programs also address gig work support, microfinance opportunities, and youth-led agrifood innovations.  

2. Education & Skills Development: Initiatives include youth-friendly educational platforms, life skills training, and efforts to reduce child labor. Projects emphasize improving formal and informal learning pathways, including digital tools and community-led trainings.  

3. Health & Wellbeing (particularly Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights â€“ SRHR): Activities center on providing youth-friendly health services, HIV prevention, mental health and psychosocial support, and comprehensive SRHR education. Emphasis is placed on making these services inclusive, accessible, and well-funded, especially in remote or underserved areas.  

4. Civic Participation & Leadership: Interventions aim to boost youth leadership in democratic institutions, civic spaces, and policymaking processes. Examples include youth advisory groups, policy consultations on youth laws, and support for inclusive governance and decision-making.  

Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited resources, both financial and technical, hamper the scale-up of youth-centered programs. Social norms and policy barriers can restrict youth agency and participation, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups. Additionally, coordination among diverse stakeholders remains a gap, limiting effective collaboration and impact.
