1) Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Strengthening Law Enforcement & Border Management  
  - Theme: Security and Justice Systems  
  - Illustration: The UN supports technical assistance to law enforcement and border agencies to investigate and prosecute transnational organized crimes—such as human trafficking and maritime crime—while also improving cooperation among neighboring countries.

• Tackling Illicit Financial Flows through Trade & Fiscal Measures  
  - Theme: Economic Governance  
  - Illustration: Efforts include modernizing customs (e.g., implementing the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement) and strengthening fiscal policy to identify and reduce tax evasion, thereby curbing money laundering and other cross-border financial crimes.

• Enhancing Cybercrime Investigation Capacity  
  - Theme: Digital Security and Governance  
  - Illustration: Criminal justice institutions receive specialized training in investigating cybercrime, equipping them with tools and legal frameworks to track and prosecute online perpetrators operating across borders.

• Safeguarding Migrants and Combatting Trafficking  
  - Theme: Migration and Human Rights  
  - Illustration: Support extends to setting up Migration Resource Centres and raising awareness of safe migration pathways, reducing vulnerabilities to cross-border trafficking and ensuring better protection for displaced and at-risk populations.

2) Potential Challenges or Gaps:  
Despite these interventions, there is often limited coordination among different national agencies, making transnational collaboration difficult. Funding constraints and a lack of specialized expertise across law enforcement and judicial systems equally hinder progress. Additionally, data-sharing frameworks and reliable information networks remain underdeveloped, impeding effective regional responses to IFF and organized crime.
