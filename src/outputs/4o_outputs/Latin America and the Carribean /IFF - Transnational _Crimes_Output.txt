1) Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Combating Organized Crime & Human Trafficking (Theme: Governance & Justice)  
  – Efforts focus on empowering law enforcement, judiciary, and border agencies to disrupt illicit networks, enhance cross-border cooperation, and protect vulnerable groups from trafficking.  

• Tackling Corruption & Economic Crimes (Theme: Governance & Justice)  
  – Emphasis is on policy reforms, capacity building of investigative bodies, and strengthening judicial processes to reduce financial leakages, encourage transparency, and improve public trust in institutions.  

• Addressing Cybercrime & Strengthening Digital Evidence Collection (Theme: Digital Transformation)  
  – Initiatives involve training stakeholders in digital forensics, safeguarding children from online exploitation, and building robust data systems to enable effective prosecution and deterrence.  

• Curbing Environmental & Wildlife Crimes (Theme: Environmental Sustainability)  
  – Programs support authorities and communities in detecting and prosecuting illegal mining, deforestation, and wildlife trafficking, while fostering sustainable livelihoods and conservation awareness.  

2) Key Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite increased collaboration across agencies, institutional capacity and resources remain limited, hindering effective enforcement. Fragmented data systems and inconsistent laws slow down progress and compromise accountability. Furthermore, governments often face competing priorities, leaving limited financial and technical support for transnational crime prevention.
