1. Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Reducing Mercury Use (Theme: Environmental Sustainability). Efforts emphasize improving artisanal and small-scale mining practices, phasing out mercury, and protecting ecosystems through responsible mining techniques.  
• Formalization and Capacity Building (Theme: Economic Empowerment). Initiatives seek to train small-scale miners, strengthen governance frameworks, and promote responsible sourcing to enhance livelihoods and market access.  
• Health Services for Miners (Theme: Health Systems). Projects expand malaria, HIV, and broader health screenings in remote mining areas, reducing disease prevalence and improving overall health outcomes among mining communities.  
• Climate Change Resilience (Theme: Climate Adaptation). Programs integrate climate considerations into mining activities, such as safe mine closures and low-emission development strategies, to safeguard communities and the environment.

Key Challenges/Gaps:  
There are persistent funding and capacity constraints that limit the reach of UN-supported programs and hinder implementation at scale. Additionally, weak policy enforcement and fragmented data collection make it difficult to track and sustain progress. Finally, balancing short-term economic gains with long-term environmental and social protections remains a central challenge across the region.
