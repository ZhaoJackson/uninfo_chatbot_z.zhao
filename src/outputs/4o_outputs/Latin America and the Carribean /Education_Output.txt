1) Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Early Childhood Development (Education Access):  
  Focus includes improving access to nurturing, inclusive care and early learning—especially for children with special needs—by strengthening policy, coordination mechanisms, and care standards.

• Teacher Capacity Building and Digital Education (Education Access):  
  Emphasis on training educators in digital pedagogies and online modalities, ensuring continuity of learning for displaced or hard-to-reach populations.

• Education Systems Strengthening (Governance and Policy):  
  Support for evidence-based policymaking through data collection (EMIS), sector expenditure reviews, and technical advice to ministries to develop robust, scalable education strategies.

• Inclusive and Second-Chance Education (Social Inclusion):  
  Initiatives target out-of-school youth, adult learners, and marginalized groups, advancing gender equality and comprehensive sexuality education to ensure equitable access to learning opportunities.

Key Challenges/Gaps (2–3 sentences):  
Implementing digital and blended learning requires reliable infrastructure and sustained teacher training, which can be resource-intensive. Persisting equity gaps—due to socioeconomic, geographic, or gender-based disparities—may limit the reach of programs, especially in remote or conflict-affected areas. Additionally, the need for stronger coordination among ministries and partners can slow policy implementation and hinder data-driven decision-making.
