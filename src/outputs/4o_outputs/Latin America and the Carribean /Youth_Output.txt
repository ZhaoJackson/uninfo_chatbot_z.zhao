1. Policy and Governance (e.g., “Youth Policy” and youth advisory councils)  
   - UN support includes helping to draft or strengthen national youth policies, establish youth advisory councils, and expand civic/voter education. This ensures youth voices are included in decision-making and legislation.  

2. Economic Empowerment and Skills Development (e.g., entrepreneurship, apprenticeships)  
   - Efforts focus on creating pathways to employment and entrepreneurship—such as quality apprenticeship programs, market access in agriculture, and technical trainings—to boost youth livelihoods and reduce vulnerability.  

3. Health and Well-Being (e.g., SRH services, psychosocial support)  
   - Initiatives target sexual and reproductive health education, mental health services, and robust youth-centered health programs, including surveys (GSHS, GYTS) that inform more responsive policies and practices.  

4. Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution (e.g., preventing violence, reintegration support)  
   - Programs emphasize youth engagement in peaceful dialogue, support for conflict-affected youth (including ex-offenders), and strengthening community-based solutions to address violence and social marginalization.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited resources and uneven capacity-building hinder the scaling of successful youth programs. Coordination among stakeholders remains a concern, with overlapping mandates leading to gaps in coverage. Additionally, geographic and digital divides can limit vulnerable youths’ access to these initiatives.
