1. Economic Empowerment:  
   • UN support focuses on equipping youth with employability skills, entrepreneurial opportunities (e.g., training in professional and digital skills), and improving access to decent jobs.  
   • Efforts include capacity building for policymakers to design youth employment policies, job creation aligned with Decent Rural Youth Employment, and establishing multi-stakeholder platforms for private-sector engagement.  

2. Civic Engagement and Governance:  
   • Programming emphasizes youth-led initiatives that strengthen rule of law, promote social cohesion, and expand youth participation in policymaking.  
   • Examples include training youth as agents of change against human trafficking, supporting community-level CSOs, and building institutional mechanisms that ensure youth voices are heard in legislative processes.  

3. Health and Social Services:  
   • The UN supports youth-friendly health services and efforts to improve sexual and reproductive health information, addressing gaps in service quality and youth engagement.  
   • Programs also work to prevent violence, substance abuse, and exploitation of children and adolescents, strengthening the capacities of law enforcement, parents, and healthcare professionals to safeguard youth well-being.  

4. Education and Skills Development:  
   • Support spans from basic professional skills training (e.g., computer literacy, CV writing) to more advanced initiatives like climate education, civic understanding, and digital innovation.  
   • Efforts also include youth-led media platforms, outreach at municipal level, and the introduction of best-practice models in youth centers to foster continuous learning and leadership.  

Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite these initiatives, resource constraints and uneven policy implementation can limit sustained impact. Institutional capacities may be weak in some areas, and there is a need for more comprehensive data and monitoring frameworks to inform evidence-based youth programming. Additionally, ensuring inclusive participation—especially for vulnerable or marginalized youth—remains a persistent challenge.
