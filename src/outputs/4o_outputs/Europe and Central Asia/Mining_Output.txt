1) Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Landmine Clearance & Community Safety (Peace and Security):  
  The UN supports clearing landmines, raising community awareness, and training local stakeholders on mine risk. This includes child-friendly reporting mechanisms and ensuring safe returns for displaced populations.  

• Institutional Capacity for Mine Action (Governance & Institutional Strengthening):  
  The UN collaborates with national agencies to develop policies, provide technical training, and integrate gender considerations in mine action programs. This strengthens coordination and promotes more robust mine risk reduction strategies.  

• Environmental Management & Mine Tailings Safety (Environmental Sustainability):  
  The UN facilitates workshops and technical support on mine tailings safety, prevention of water pollution, and nature-based solutions. This approach minimizes environmental hazards from mining and builds resilience against climate-related risks.  

• Socio-Economic Empowerment in Mining Communities (Economic Empowerment):  
  The UN supports community-driven initiatives for sustainable, responsible mining, reducing poverty and improving livelihoods. This includes efforts to align mining with climate change pledges and equitable economic development.  

2) Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
Key gaps include insufficient technical expertise and funding to clear mines and manage tailings effectively, which slows progress in remote or conflict-affected regions. Integrating climate objectives with safe mining practices also demands coordinated policies and advanced technologies that are often limited locally. Stronger data collection, inclusive governance, and sustained capacity building remain critical for uniting peace, development, and environmental objectives.
