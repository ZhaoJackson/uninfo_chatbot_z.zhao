1) Four Main Areas of Focus (2024):

• Inclusive Education and Access (Theme: Education Access)  
  - Illustration: UN support bolsters opportunities for children and youth—especially marginalized groups, refugees, and out-of-school learners—to enroll in both formal and non-formal educational programs. This includes improving school infrastructure, teacher training, and targeted outreach.

• Comprehensive Sexuality Education and Gender Mainstreaming (Theme: Gender Equality)  
  - Illustration: Technical advocacy and curriculum development ensure high-quality sexuality education is integrated into school systems. Gender-sensitive teaching and strong youth engagement help shape positive social norms and reduce discrimination.

• Education in Emergencies and Crisis Situations (Theme: Humanitarian/Emergency Support)  
  - Illustration: Non-formal learning initiatives and psychosocial support safeguard the right to education for displaced learners and children in conflict-affected communities. Efforts often include emergency curriculum adaptations, accelerated learning, and resilience-building for teachers and students.

• Skills Development and Lifelong Learning (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
  - Illustration: Support for vocational training centers, digital literacy, green skills, and entrepreneurship programs paves the way for improved employment prospects. Lifelong learning roadmaps and partnerships with ministries help align education with labor market needs.

2) Key Challenges/Gaps:
Persistent funding shortfalls, especially in fragile contexts, limit infrastructure upgrades and the expansion of quality teacher training. Coordination among education, health, and social services can be uneven, making it harder to deliver integrated services. Additionally, digital divides and resource constraints hamper efforts to expand innovative learning and outreach for the most vulnerable populations.
