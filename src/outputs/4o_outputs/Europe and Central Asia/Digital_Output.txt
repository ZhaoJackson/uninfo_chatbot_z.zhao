2) Key challenges/gaps:  
Despite progress in building digital infrastructure and skills, insufficient connectivity and limited digital literacy still constrain broad usage. Data privacy and cybersecurity frameworks remain underdeveloped, and resource constraints often slow national digitalization plans, making it critical to mobilize robust partnerships and investments. Finally, coordination hurdles among multiple stakeholders can undermine the scalability and sustainability of digital initiatives.
