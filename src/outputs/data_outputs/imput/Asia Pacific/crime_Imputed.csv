A pivotal achievement is the initiation of the establishment of a National Counter Narcotics Coordination Center, set to operate under the Ministry of Narcotics Control. This center will serve as a critical hub for coordinating efforts against narcotics-related crimes, bolstering institutional capabilities.To enhance law enforcement agencies' effectiveness, targeted training programs have been implemented. Notably, 72 males and 1 female received training in Maritime capabilities, while 22 males and 5 females underwent the In-flight Security Officer (IFSO) Training Course. These initiatives aim to fortify interdiction, investigation, case preparation, and prosecution capacities, ensuring a robust response to organized crimes. In the maritime domain, a significant development includes the creation of interagency guidance on the 'handling of stateless and unflagged vessels.' This guidance, tailored for disrupting drugs and contraband trafficking along Pakistan's coastal areas, demonstrates a strategic approach to address maritime-based organized crimes. Moreover, 491 personnel from law enforcement agencies were trained in Mutual Legal Assistance, investigation and prosecution, open-source intelligence, victim protection, data collection and management related to TIP and SOM. International Organization for Migration (IOM)IOM has identified forgery detection toolkits for training participants as part of pedagogical and technical support as complementary to the capacity-building sessions under Output 1.1. The procurement process of 50 toolkits has been launched, and will be handed over to immigration officials during the upcoming training. These kits include the latest technological equipment necessary to detect fraudulent documents and include items such as ultraviolet lamps, retro viewers, microscopes, stand loupes, eye loupes, size templates, tweezers, and spare lamps.216 individuals (58 females and 158 males) members of TIP committees and CSOs trained on victim identification, screening and referral and data management practices. Under this output, IOM plans to install the Verifier TDB at seven international airports in Pakistan (Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Peshawar, Sialkot and Quetta). The Verifier TDB is a secondary-line inspection tool developed by IOM within the framework of its DESC Initiative to support immigration and border officials in confirming the first analysis of the validity of the travel documents.During this reporting period, IOM Pakistan in close coordination with IOM‚Äôs Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific organized the study visit of a high-level delegation from the GoP from 16 to 19 May 2023. The six-member delegation from Pakistan (comprising of four male and two females)was headed by the Additional Secretary ‚ÄìBorder Management at MoI, and comprised of senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(MoFA), FIA , Directorate General (DG) Immigration and Passports and National Database and Registration Authority of Pakistan (NADRA).Preliminary meetings were held with the Director of Training, FIA Academy about the refurbishment plan. Initial survey of the academy in terms of refurbishment requirements completed for an onward detailed road map to carry out refurbishment works. Procurement process initiated for the simultaneous supply of ICT equipment to the academy, including laptops, LEDs, printers, and projectors. Activity is continued and will be completed in 2024. IOM facilitated the visit of two GoP officials (2 males, 0 females), 1 from the Ministry of Interior and 1 from the Federal Investigation Agency to the 8th Annual Meeting of the Asian Network for Document Examination (ANDEX) Meeting, in Bangkok, Thailand. Pakistan showcased their achievements and best practices in document examination TIP and SOM. Emphasis was placed on Pakistan‚Äôs complex border structures, relevant agencies, and trends related to deportees on forged documents.IOM facilitated the visit of 7 government officials (2 females and 5 males) in IOM‚Äôs DESC in Bangkok and the Thai Immigration Bureau. The delegation composition was as follows: (Ministry of Interior, Directorate General Immigration and Passports, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Database and Registration Authority, Federal Investigation Agency, The visit included the practical steps necessary for Pakistan‚Äôs inclusion in the Verifier TDB. The visit also entailed a meeting with officials of the Thai Immigration Bureau on strengthening capacities of document verification, and a live demonstration of the verifier TDB e-dashboards.IOM Pakistan supported the participation of a senior government delegation from Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (MoOPHRD) in Colombo Process‚Äô sixth Pre- Departure Orientation and Empowerment (PDOE) Thematic Area Working Group (TAWG) meeting and IOM‚Äôs Corporate Responsibility in Eliminating Slavery and Trafficking (CREST) Programme‚Äô Round Table Discussion on The Future of Remedy for Migrant Workers in Asia, held in Bangkok, Thailand from the 16th to 17th of August 2023. Noting the relevance of the events to Pakistan‚Äôs priorities, costs associated with participation of one senior official from the delegation were supported within the framework of this project.IOM continued close follow-up with the MoI to secure approvals for conducting a physical assessment of the Points of Entry (PoEs), consultations with key personnel to validate the inputs shared by FIA, and to secure inputs from other concerned authorities such as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) at airports. The assessment will define a concrete list of items to be provided to selected PoEs, which will be devised as part of the overall project objective to strengthen border management capacity.IOM received preliminary inputs from the FIA for this output during the previous reporting period. IOM proceeded with the procurement of items after formal approval from the MoI. A meeting was organised in June 2023 with the newly appointed Additional Secretary ‚Äì Border Management of the MoI to share an overview of upcoming IOM activities, as well to follow-up on the approval for a border management assessment. Infrastructural support may include document verification tools, IT equipment, office furniture, general refurbishment of spaces, computer systems, and surveillance cameras (CCTV) for various border crossings in Pakistan. ",10034047.0,7811356.13,7076985.4,"IOM:Pakistan's FIA immigration authorities benefited from increased capacities to detect irregularities and criminal activities at the country's borders thanks to capacity building efforts in the area of biometrics, gender-sensitive border management, and investigation techniques, This effort was sustained through a train-the-trainer model, where 14 officers were equipped as master trainers and successfully transferred their knowledge to eighty eight junior officers. Institutional knowledge retention was strengthened, with pre- and post-training assessments indicating an 80% improvement in participants' understanding. Government officials from NADRA and MoI gained insights into best practices for legal identity and border management by participating in the Border Management and Identity Conference (BMIC) in Bangkok. Exposure to cutting-edge technologies and emerging developments equipped two government officials with the knowledge needed to enhance border security and prepare for the transition to more advanced systems. Two government officials from Pakistan enhanced their expertise in countering human trafficking and migrant smuggling by participating in the Regional Workshop on Trafficking in Human Beings (THB) and Smuggling of Migrants (SoM) held in Tehran, Iran, in July 2024. Facilitated under the IOM-ECO Memorandum of Understanding, the workshop provided a platform for knowledge exchange among ECO member states, civil society, and international organizations. Participants gained insights into legislative frameworks, national strategies, and victim protection services, equipping them with methodologies to strengthen collective measures against trafficking and smuggling. Government officials and civil society representatives deepened their understanding of Global Compact for Migration (GCM) implementation by attending the South Asia Sub-Regional Consultation in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in November 2024. Organized by the Regional UN Network on Migration, the consultation assessed regional progress, identified policy gaps, and facilitated best practice sharing. Discussions emphasized a human rights-based approach to migration and highlighted civil society‚Äôs role in shaping effective migration governance. The outcomes contributed to a regional action plan aimed at strengthening safe, orderly, and regular migration pathways across South Asia Efforts to enhance labor migration governance advanced through a Needs Assessment Session for the Essentials of Migration Management (EMM) training program in Islamabad. 7 senior officials from FIA, NADRA, MoPHRD, and BEOE engaged in discussions to identify capacity-building needs, challenges, and collaboration opportunities. This session laid the groundwork for a tailored EMM training program, ensuring targeted interventions to strengthen migration management in Pakistan. Public awareness and policy engagement on irregular migration and human rights were reinforced through two launch events for the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) report Perilous Journeys: Unraveling Irregular Migration from Pakistan in Lahore and Karachi. Supported by the Canadian High Commission, IOM, and the Embassy of Denmark, these events convened government officials, civil society, and stakeholders to discuss migration challenges and policy solutions. The launch fostered meaningful dialogue, strengthened stakeholder engagement, and positioned the report as a critical resource for evidence-based migration policymaking. In person workshop was conducted in April 2024 to discuss the modalities of the existing Readmission Case Management System (RCMS) platform, enhancement of its sustainability and increasing cooperation between all relevant stakeholders from Pakistan and the European Union Stakeholder coordination on readmission processes improved through an in-person workshop in April 2024, which reviewed the Readmission Case Management System (RCMS) and explored strategies for enhancing its sustainability and cooperation between Pakistan and the European Union. Additionally, a deployment mission to Hungary facilitated the system‚Äôs installation and provided targeted training for NADRA, MoI, and MoFA technical officials, alongside IOM experts from Pakistan and the EURCAP Facility. These efforts ensured the operationalization and long-term sustainability of the RCMS platform. Institutional collaboration for safe and regular migration pathways advanced with the completion of an initial stakeholder mapping exercise. This ongoing process will expand to include additional stakeholders, who will receive specialized training in February 2025 to promote safe migration practices and policies. UNODC: Institutional responses to drug trafficking have been strengthened, with 25 officials (including 2 females) trained in enhanced coordination and inter-agency collaboration, leading to improved investigative and enforcement efforts against narcotics-related crimes.Efforts to combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM) have been significantly reinforced, with 262 officials (71 females) acquiring advanced investigative techniques, case management skills, and prosecution strategies. This has resulted in greater efficiency in identifying, investigating, and prosecuting TIP and SOM cases, ensuring better protection for victims and accountability for offenders.Aviation security has been substantially enhanced, with 107 officials (18 females) trained in managing unruly passengers, aircraft searches, and crisis response, leading to improved safety measures and risk mitigation in airports and inflight operations.Maritime security and cross-border coordination have been strengthened, with 104 law enforcement personnel (3 females) trained in legal frameworks, operational readiness, and specialized courses such as VBSS and maritime domain awareness. This has resulted in enhanced maritime surveillance, better coordination among agencies, and improved readiness to address security threats at sea.Overall, these initiatives have improved institutional effectiveness, strengthened multi-agency collaboration, and enhanced operational capacities to combat organized crime, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure safer borders and transport networks.",14311477.0,10124266.25,7090001.07,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
