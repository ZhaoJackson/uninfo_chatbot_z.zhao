Under the project, WFP provided an unconditional cash grant of PKR 15,000/ each graduated PLW for improving their diet intake with liberty to utilize the cash for initiating or diversifying livelihoods and diversifying income-generation options so that they can earn or save an income to meet their own and their children‚Äôs food needs that remained unmet due to poverty, low levels of income and corresponding limited affordability. 
The support was meant to assist in strengthening the prevention component of the continuum of care and further reduce relapse while improving and adopting appropriate good feeding practices and a healthy diet through income diversifying activities. A total of 2,446 households of pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children treated under Community Based Treatment of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) were assisted with one-time unconditional cash assistance of PKR 36.6 M to support their diversified food consumption and/or contribute to initiating income diversifying activities under the ‚ÄúCMAM-Safety Net‚Äù initiative.
An end assessment of the project was conducted to assess the overall impact of the project. A total of 92% of the interviewed households reported project benefits in terms of health and nutrition education and through income support for their households. For the utilization of cash, approximately 78% of the interviewed beneficiaries invested in livestock by spending most of the amount on purchasing goats. Some purchased lactating goats, some lamb while one of the beneficiaries purchased buffalo by selling two goats and adding the received amount of PKR 15,000. Approximately 7% of the interviewed beneficiaries purchased sewing machines as a productive asset with an assumption of earning money by stitching clothes. 7% of the interviewed beneficiaries invested money to start a small business or to further extend the current business. One of the beneficiary households used the cash assistance to pay off the installment of the auto-rickshaw that it had purchased as a source of livelihood. 2% of the beneficiaries shared that they had spent the money for their medical needs. One beneficiary had spent the money on her delivery while another had paid the money to bear the expenses of her daughter who has cardiac issues. However, 8% of the beneficiaries shared that the amount received had not changed their income generation but had considerably helped them to meet their food needs.

The first is short-term assistance in providing immediate food distribution among the worst impacted or more marginalized communities in the BARMM and adjacent areas in Mindanao. The second is mid-term support to improve livelihood in Bangsamoro through enhancing the capacity of Community Cooperative Groups (including women‚Äôs associations) and strengthening food value chains for the agricultural and fishery sectors towards food security. The project will also contribute to addressing the socio-economic impacts of natural and human-induced disasters in the BARMM, particularly in the aftermath of tropical storm Nalgae (Paeng) which severely affected vulnerable communities in the region.

By improving basic food sufficiency and economic stability in post-conflict Bangsamoro, this project could contribute to achieving SDGs 2: Zero hunger because food shortages could be alleviated, and nutrition could be improved; and SDGs 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions because implementation capacity of local authorities and community groups could be improved to build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions and to promote sustainable agriculture and fishery. Hence, peaceful and inclusive communities for sustainable development could be promoted.

The initial phase involved a thorough evaluation of the technical skills of lab inspectors across national laboratories spanning human, veterinary, and food domains. These labs actively participated in international proficiency testing to ensure their capabilities aligned with global standards in the critical fight against AMR. Recognizing the paramount importance of public awareness in tackling AMR, efforts extended to engaging the younger generation. Specialized awareness training sessions were conducted for school children, providing them with a simplified understanding of how AMR emerges and offering guidance on safeguarding against it. To amplify this message, collaboration with influential figures among children was fostered, activating a network capable of promoting awareness and encouraging proactive measures against the growing threat of Antimicrobial Resistance.

Progress, with an emphasis on Government ownership, has been possible through the operationalization of the Rice Fortification Technical Working Group jointly established with the government in 2022.In 2023, WFP achieved two significant advocacy objectives. First: the release of the National Food Agency Regulation No. 2/2023 on Rice Quality and Labelling Standards. This regulation expands the grades of rice eligible for fortification, effectively lowering the cost and increasing the affordability and availability of domestically produced fortified rice. Second, WFP through joint efforts with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established consensus among stakeholders on the criticality of scaled-up rice fortification to prevent micronutrient deficiencies. This was achieved through convening stakeholders for policy engagement and leveraging evidence generated under activities with government and other stakeholders. The consensus subsequently enabled joint advocacy for the prioritization of fortified foods, including fortified rice, in the next National Medium- and Long-Term National Development Plan.The achievements above were further bolstered by the emerging partnership between WFP and the National Food Agency and engagement with a larger, multi-year, multi-agency initiative to establish national standards for fortified rice and rice kernels. WFP and the Agency finalized and began to implement a joint 2023-2024 workplan to support the Agency‚Äôs efforts in developing further guidelines on fortified rice production.

All targets under Component 2 (Innovations for investing in women) were met or exceeded in 2023. For instance, Agribusiness opportunities were identified (12 compared to 9 set at design); the agribusiness skills training material was developed and the target was exceeded through inclusion of the Basic Numeracy programme to tailor and enhance effectiveness in reaching and empowering women, given the baseline findings and in line with the programme's adaptative management. Targets were also exceeded by 237% with regards to attendees to capacity building sessions, market linkage events, competitions, and exposure visits with 64% women reached.

This information also supplemented the development of the road map with evidence-based suggestions for incorporation of food security and nutrition (FSN) into forestry and related initiatives in the broader institutional context of Sri Lanka.
Technical assistance provided for pilot intervention targeting agroforestry through the project. A plant nursery, consisting of a net house, plant house, compost hut and nursery beds, was constructed in Tambuttegama, Anuradhapura with the intention of supporting community livelihoods and promoting related forest nursery activities by the Forest Department. 
Community participants (50) of Kahatagasdigiliya and surrounded areas were trained on home garden improvement and plant nursery management for food and nutritional security and livelihood improvement. A ToT program was conducted for the Forest Department extension officers on home garden and nursery management, tree propagation techniques, with special emphasis on how the extension officers can support the local communities in promoting home gardens, plant nurseries and agroforestry initiatives for food and nutritional security and livelihood improvement.

One key component is livestock protection and management interventions. This involves implementing measures to safeguard the health and well-being of livestock, such as providing vaccinations, improving animal husbandry practices, and establishing early warning systems for disease outbreaks. Additionally, support is given to farmers in managing their livestock effectively, including guidance on breeding, feeding, and ensuring proper shelter.

Another crucial element of the strategy is skills training and entrepreneurship development. This is where ILO will focus on equipping individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge, they can enhance their capacity to earn a sustainable income. Skills training programs can focus on a range of sectors, such as agriculture, handicrafts, or small-scale manufacturing. Additionally, entrepreneurship development initiatives can empower individuals to start their own businesses, providing them with opportunities for income generation and economic resilience.

Furthermore, ILO's strategy will emphasizes the creation of labour-intensive employment opportunities. This involves promoting sectors that have the potential to absorb a large number of workers, such as infrastructure development, construction, or public works projects. By providing employment opportunities, especially during times of shocks or crises, individuals can access income to meet their immediate needs, reducing their vulnerability to food insecurity.

Lastly, the strategy incorporates shock-responsive social protection frameworks. These frameworks aim to provide a safety net for individuals and communities affected by shocks, such as natural disasters or economic downturns. They include mechanisms such as cash transfers, food assistance programs, and social insurance schemes. These social protection measures can help individuals cope with the impacts of shocks, maintain their food security, and mitigate the negative consequences on their livelihoods.

In summary, facilitating shock-responsive livelihoods programs for food security requires a multi-faceted approach. Livestock protection and management interventions ensure the well-being of animals and support farmers in effectively managing their livestock. Skills training and entrepreneurship development equip individuals with the necessary tools to earn a sustainable income. Labor-intensive employment opportunities provide immediate income generation during shocks or crises, while shock-responsive social protection frameworks offer a safety net to mitigate the impacts of shocks on livelihoods. By integrating these strategies, communities can enhance their resilience, ensuring sustainable food security and promoting long-term economic well-being.

In Chhattisgarh, youth-led initiatives in 16 districts reached 675,000 people with messages on healthy diets and anemia prevention. About 200,000 households in tribal districts were reached through community-based programs (‚ÄúPotth Laika‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaapi Na Uwaat‚Äù). Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan developed and rolled-out state SBC guidelines including CBEs tools and templates for transformative men engagement in alignment with the ‚ÄúPurush Bane Zimmedar‚Äù initiative under POSHAN 2.0. In Assam, 26,355 adolescents (20,514 girls and 5,841 boys) were reached through Adolescent Friendly Centers established in 205 tea gardens. Government in six states supported BIU to conduct behavioral studies in collaboration with UNICEF. Results are being used to develop culturally adapted solutions to nutritional behavior barriers focusing on diet diversity for complementary feeding, maternal nutrition and Iron-Folic Acid supplementation.FAO:FAO contributed to strengthening nutrition education and food safety practices through two key interventions: the piloting of the ENACT course in academic institutions and capacity building in the spices value chain.To promote nutrition education and healthy diets, FAO collaborated with the Indian Council of Medical Research ‚Äì National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN) and other academic institutions to pilot the Education for Effective Nutrition in Action (ENACT) course in India. The course materials have undergone expert review and are being finalised for rollout. Once implemented, ENACT will help develop a cadre of trained professionals equipped to integrate nutrition education into food systems and community-level interventions, aligning with national goals for healthier diets and nutrition-sensitive agriculture.In parallel, FAO implemented a comprehensive spices value chain project to build knowledge and awareness on food safety and hygienic handling practices. Over 1,700 farmers (including 535 women) and 200 value chain stakeholders‚Äîsuch as FPO representatives, exporters, traders, and government officials‚Äîacross Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan were trained on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Hygienic Practices (GHP). The training was delivered through in-person sessions, group activities, refresher courses, and exposure visits.To scale outreach, FAO developed 60 short training videos in Hindi, Gujarati, and Telugu focused on safe and hygienic spice production (cumin, coriander, fennel, and black pepper). These videos, tailored to local contexts, reached over 6,000 farmers‚Äîincluding 300 women‚Äîand are being integrated into the Ministry of Agriculture‚Äôs VISTAAR mobile application to ensure long-term accessibility. Over 96% of participants found the trainings highly useful.These initiatives not only strengthened knowledge on food safety and healthy diets but also enhanced digital literacy and market linkages, ensuring that smallholders‚Äîparticularly women‚Äîare better equipped to adopt nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices.WHO: WHO supported the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), MoHFW to revise their national regulation defining compositional and marketing/promotion standards for infant foods to align them with the latest WHO recommendations on nutrient profile and promotion standards with the primary aim to improve the nutritional quality of these foods to promote healthy diet and end inappropriate promotion of food products meant for older infants and young children. The technical support aimed to strengthen regulatory landscape to ensure that no misleading health and nutrition claims are used by manufacturers to market their products as healthy while simultaneously pushing them to reformulate their products to reduce the energy, sugar, fat and sodium content.To support implementation of the WHO global sodium benchmarks in India in combination with policies aiming to reduce discretionary sodium intake, WHO India generated evidence for policy making and published it as a paper titled ‚ÄúEstimated benefits and risks of lowering sodium through potassium-enriched salt substitution in India‚Äù and ‚ÄúEstimated health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of implementing WHO‚Äôs sodium benchmarks for packaged foods in India: a modelling study‚Äù in reputed journals including Lancet Public Health. This will help inform policy makers in the design, planning, and implementation of relevant policies on use of low sodium salt substitutes at population level for prevention/management of hypertension. These publications were widely covered in media and have been a great advocacy tool with the government.",2801106.0,2159346.23,1829625.35,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

FLW is a manifestation of poorly functioning food systems. It is widely recognized that significant levels of FLW occur in the food supply chain from production to consumption. Although underlying many fish loss and waste issues is quality and spoilage, solutions to FLW are wide ranging, complex and interlinked.

This included the finalization of a joint WFP-Government feasibility assessment conducted across five provinces, generating evidence to inform national and sub-national development plans. Through convening multi-sector consultation processes, WFP enabled the deepening of stakeholder engagement, promoted government ownership, and supported the defining of anticipatory action within the Indonesian context by building on existing Government systems. WFP capacity strengthening investments included the facilitation of a South-South Triangular Cooperation knowledge exchange between the Governments of Indonesia and the Philippines. This resulted in learning and knowledge exchange on early warning systems and the institutionalization of anticipatory action into national governance, legal structures, and funding and coordination mechanisms.   WFP in partnership with the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs convened the First National Dialogue on Anticipatory Action ‚Äì a key milestone in the collective effort to institutionalize anticipatory action at the national level. This catalytic platform enabled stakeholder collaboration ‚Äì including those of WFP and partners to strengthen the Government‚Äôs support and recognition of anticipatory action, integration of its principles into early warning systems and funding mechanisms, and critical to minimizing the impact of disasters. This platform will be key to the development of national anticipatory action guidelines and frameworks. ",842498.0,742890.34,647448.39,"WFP in partnership with the National Disaster Management Agency facilitated consensus on the national operational definition of anticipatory action within the Indonesian Government system as ‚ÄúAction in Response to Early Warning‚Äù (Aksi Merespon Peringatan Dini or AMPD). This consensus and the subsequent codification of the operational definition in the National Disaster Management Agency Regulation No. 2/2024 marked a significant achievement in ensuring a synchronized anticipatory action approach at national and subnational levels. WFP partnered with provincial governments to test the integration of anticipatory action into existing government systems, expanding on the pilot models established in 2023 in the provinces of Yogyakarta, West Kalimantan, and East Nusa Tenggara. These provinces cover a population of 15 million people across three major Indonesian islands. The testing of models and the results achieved at the provincial and district levels now provide the foundation for an evidence-based integration of the anticipatory action system at the national level. In Yogyakarta, WFP and the local government finalized the development of a provincial contingency plan and operational guidelines for tropical cyclones, integrating anticipatory action principles for strengthened disaster risk management mechanisms. This included defining early action triggers for national authorities to declare an emergency and initiate response with national resources, even before the impacts of the disaster are felt by the population. Further strengthening anticipatory action in the province, WFP successfully advocated for the legalization of the operational guideline and contingency plan through a Governor‚Äôs Decree.  In West Kalimantan, WFP and partners mainstreamed anticipatory action into the national Climate Field School curriculum and built local sensitization and training of trainer models for wider implementation. The Climate Field School is a national programme that equips over 1,000 farmers and community facilitators annually with the knowledge and skills to manage agricultural resources and adapt their practices to climate variability.  In East Nusa Tenggara, drought conditions persisted and were exacerbated by climate anomalies. In response, WFP and government partners advanced the integration of anticipatory action into the provincial contingency plan for drought. As a result, the local government endorsed the plan and swiftly informed a declaration of emergency based on early warning for the province from June to December 2024, enabling access to on-call funds for early action in anticipation of drought. In parallel, WFP and the East Nusa Tenggara Province Climate Task Force achieved the integration of the findings on food security and climate risks from the 2023 Consolidated Livelihood Exercise for Analysing Resilience (CLEAR+) study into the East Nusa Tenggara 2025-2045 Long-Term Provincial Development Plan. This will inform the formulation of provincial development plans, programmes, and resource allocation towards improved livelihoods and food security among populations most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

Up to now, FOLUR Project Indonesia has taken initial yet critical set step in progressing with implementing the Integrated Landscape Management (ILM) approach. Whilst the definitive baseline will be determined in year 3 after the ILM plans are endorsed, in the meantime, through an inclusive and participative multi stakeholder dialogue process, project has made initial assessment with regard to the potential area for intervention at district level, which will inform the more comprehensive baseline assessment for area of land restored. This also reflects the progress of CPD Indicator related to Output Indicator 3.4.1: Number of adaptive landscape management strategies that build social, economic and ecological resilience tested/adopted at the district level.  Component 1: ILM FOLUR Project Indonesia has taken initial yet critical set in progressing with implementing the Integrated Landscape Management (ILM) approach.  Whilst the definitive baseline will be determined in year 3 after the ILM plans are endorsed, in the meantime, through an inclusive and participative multi stakeholder dialogue process, project has made initial assessment with regard to the potential area for intervention at district level, which will inform the more comprehensive baseline assessment for area of land restored.  TSA and HCV studies currently have been done in three project locations to provide a more robust baseline, namely in: Central Aceh, Aceh; Mandailing Natal, North Sumatera; and Luwu, South Sulawesi. TSA and HCV studies currently underway in two project locations to provide a more robust baseline, namely in: Sanggau District, Kalimantan Barat Province and Sorong District, Papua Barat Daya Province. Decisions Support Tool system: under development of initial term of reference.  CPD Indicator related to Output Indicator 3.4.1: Number of adaptive landscape management strategies that build social, economic and ecological resilience tested/adopted at the district level. Project has been identified 65 indicative villages then 25 villages have been verified as priority intervention sites in five district of FOLUR site locations. Facilitation on establishing multistakeholher forum (task force) for Papua Barat Daya and Kalimantan Barat Provinces. Formulation of Sustainable Palm Oil Regional Action Plan (RAD-KSB) in Mandailing Natal and Sanggau Districts have been facilitated for supporting sustainable commodity action plan.  Component 2: Sustainable Commodity Production The preparatory work to identify potential targeted sites and beneficiaries in the 5 targeted districts was completed.  This included a series of more than 30 participative multistakeholder dialogues ILM related activities both at national and sub-national level through which consultations were undertaken with more than 5000 potential beneficiaries, of which around 2000 were women, creating ownership in the process with them.  As a result, a clearer indication and picture of initial beneficiaries was obtained in Sorong, Central Aceh, Mandailing Natal, Sanggau and Luwu and is estimated at 52,838 (22,644 women).  In terms of CPD Indicator, this refers to the progress of CPD Indicator related to Output Indicator 3.1.3: Number of men and women who have benefitted from improved governance of commodities productions at land and sea.  Component 3: Conservation and Restoration In the meantime, the project has not restored any degraded areas yet, but to progress towards defining the baseline of restoring the area of land including forest land, the project has determined the possible area that can be restored in each of the 5 districts.  58,894 hectares in total were identified including 5,380 hectares in Central Aceh, 3,651 hectares in Mandailing Natal, 5,222 in Sanggau, 34,172 in Sorong and 10,469 hectares in Luwu.  The project also made an initial determination that restoration could be targeted on forest land equaling 37,910. The project is on track to have more specific estimates by year 3 and is expected to meet the 20,000 hectares end target. ",2639681.0,2040018.77,1439496.72,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

FAO supported and developed ten (10) business plans for agriculture and livestock value chains, covering grapes, olives, dates, fruit and vegetable drying, and tunnel farming. Initiatives within the livestock value chains included modernising dairy farming, establishing wool collection centres, improving sheep and goat fattening practices, upgrading butcher shops, and introducing a semen production unit. These efforts aimed to enhance productivity, while promoting low water use, and improving market access across the agricultural and livestock sectors.UN Women:During the reporting period, 729 women farmers enhanced their knowledge and skills in maximizing profits through marketing, value addition and post-harvest handling of agricultural produce. This initiative aims to empower women farmers by equipping them to seize profitable opportunities at local and regional levels, thereby contributing to increased household incomes.As part of UN Women's initiative to promote inclusive economic opportunities through sustainable agricultural practices, 634 women farmers haveenhanced their skills in financial literacy and savings during the reporting period in the districts of Khyber, Mohmand. These women farmers are equipped with essential financial management skills, empowering them to make informed decisions on savings and investments.

Regular Project Steering Committees were organized between Grant recipients‚Äô representatives and IFAD‚Äôs Grant Manager, to present progress and discuss challenges. A learning event was jointly attended in September 2023 in Solomon Islands, bringing together the Alliance Bioversity International ‚Äì CIAT as well as the World Vision Vanuatu and Solomon Islands implementation teams. This served to identify key milestones during the program‚Äôs last year of implementation, and identify priority for expert knowledge transfer between the Alliance and World Visions staff on the ground. Physical targets were attained and in some cases exceeded, for instance through the establishment and support to 29 saving groups (161% targets met), or facilitating the participation of 1,282 to market linkage events and exposure visits (237% targets met). In 2023, updated logframe shows 69% women involved in the nutritional behavioural change strategy design, hence including their voice in the decision-making and prioritization process. All targets under Component 2 (Innovations for investing in women) were met or exceeded in 2023. For instance, Agribusiness opportunities were identified (12 compared to 9 set at design); the agribusiness skills training material was developed and the target was exceeded through inclusion of the Basic Numeracy programme to tailor and enhance effectiveness in reaching and empowering women, given the baseline findings and in line with the programme's adaptative management. Targets were also exceeded by 237% with regards to attendees to capacity building sessions, market linkage events, competitions, and exposure visits with 64% women reached.

In 2021, WFP continued its cash-based relief response for the families that were affected by heavy monsoon rainfall in the Sindh province in 2020, and those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks in the most vulnerable districts of Balochistan, Sindh, and  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The provision of relief food assistance to families that remained displaced in KP province also continued in 2021. All three interventions were concluded in the first half of the year. In the latter half of the year, upon request from the host Government, WFP provided life-saving food assistance to families that were affected by heavy rainfall and flash flooding in three districts of KP. All these interventions were implemented at the behest of and in close collaboration with all relevant government departments at the federal and provincial levels.
