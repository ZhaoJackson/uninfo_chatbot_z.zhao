Around 150 religious leaders and faith-based organizations are now part of the UNICEF-supported religious leaders‚Äô forum at the national level and in the Eastern province. Hate speech prevention program implementation commenced in seven selected divisional secretariats of the Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts during this period. Multi-stakeholder steering committees were formed in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts to coordinate and provide technical oversight on peace and social cohesion promotion in the regions. The training manual on digital literacy, digital storytelling, and social cohesion was finalized and used to train Child Rights Promotion Officers (CRPOs), Youth Service Officers (YSOs), children‚Äôs/youth club members, and religious leaders. Further, through the established religious leaders‚Äô forum, approximately 383 community members were reached through messaging on civic responsibility, violence prevention, hate speech, and promotion of peace and social cohesion.

UNDP  - A growing interest and commitment to action from youth to better challenge misinformation and hate speech was evident with over 1500 young people participating in courses to improve their media literacy skills and volunteer to be 'Engage to Disengage Advocates'; with 27 independent community campaigns conducted to date.

This involved close engagement with religious leaders through the establishment of three district-level religious leader forums and training of religious leaders (32) on digital literacy and the effective use of social media, reaching approximately 562 community members through messaging on civic responsibility, violence prevention, hate speech and promotion of peace and social cohesion. UNICEF expanded its work with adolescents and youth on hate speech in hotspots in five districts (Batticaloa, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Badulla and Kandy) together with 172 government officers trained as master trainers on hate speech prevention. Through them, 867 adolescents/youth (456 boys and 411 girls, including 8 children with disabilities) were engaged. NIE has initiated promoting digital citizenship skills, using the Media subject for grades 8-11. This includes the development of platforms to help students engage and promote positive narratives.UNDP - Empowerment of leadership activities for youth and cohesion has been promoted through the support provided for four CSOs (Roar Media, NCEASL, CEJ and SFCG). Over 50 selected female leaders (out of 200 applicants) across Government institutions and CSOs increased their understanding of combatting hate speech and disinformation following trainings and capacity building on exploring methods to address hate speech. The capacity building will focus on digital literacy and effective digital responses to hate speech and disinformation for selected 25 women influencers.

Through this UNV will provide technical assistance on volunteer management, volunteer management and volunteering to achieve  2030 Agenda. Youth leaders will be trained with required skills and knowledge to engage their communities through volunteer mobilization.  The approximate expenditure for 2021 received through UNDP is USD 100,000.  
WHO- ‚Ä¢The project employs a ‚ÄúHealthy settings‚Äù approach; a unique concept that uses health as an entry-point for peacebuilding and community empowerment by placing youth as change agents. The Youth Parliament and the existing youth networks are used to combine aspirations of young political leaders and the needs of the community to address social inequalities and enable healthier and safer settings. The project utilizes capacity building and multi-stakeholder action towards community empowerment to drive a collective youth-led process for community-owned sustainable peacebuilding efforts.

The project developed 20 modules that were identified by NYSC together with the UN Agencies as crucial to orient and capacitate the participants on healthy settings, community development and volunteerism in-line with the overarching project objective of empowering young people in promoting health and wellbeing, volunteerism and collective action for promoting social cohesion. The modules utilize a participatory and problem-based learning approach with various hands-on activities to encourage participants to engage and interact. The programme is conducted in local languages to ensure equitable access.

The COVID 19 has impacted significantly on the capacity building trainings due to the limitations of ensuring impact on soft skill development components of the programme that relies of participant engagement to drive the peacebuilding outcomes. However, the project has incorporated an online Learning Management System as part of its design to ensure sustainability of the programme. Youth parlimantarian from Gampaha District, Malshan Perera, who attended a capacity building programme had the following to say: ‚ÄúTo be future leaders of tomorrow who  find solutions to social issues, to think on your own, to think creatively, to identify and understand your duties as a youth, and to become a responsible citizen; the YCLI programme is the perfect opportunity to help us all. Together through this programme youth from across the nation - youth parliamentarians, university students, and youth from other organisations and CSO‚Äôs have come together to start a new journey on creating a new and better Sri Lanka. Through this programme we discussed problems that have never been addressed and found solutions to these problems together with the project team.

These initiatives encompass alternative learning pathways, afternoon schools, and non-formal skills development components, across all provinces. Additionally, UNICEF's efforts are geared towards enhancing the quality of education at the middle level, particularly leveraging digital technologies. Thus far, 12,322 adolescents in Balochistan, KP, and Sindh have benefitted from these initiatives aimed at improving educational standards. In the context of enhancing capacities to deliver quality education and skills development to adolescents, a key document, the GenU country operating plan was finalized. In addition, an innovative, evidence-based model was developed to integrate accelerated learning, skills training, and labor market linkages, offering a hybrid solution for out of school adolescents.To expand access to learning opportunities for out of school adolescents, various interventions were implemented. This includes post-primary learning in non-formal centre reaching 11,629 adolescents (73 per cent girls); afternoon schools for 92,072 adolescents (62 per cent girls), and blended education and skills development programmes initiated in Balochistan and Punjab. Furthermore, a programme enhancing 21st century skills for 1,700 out of school adolescent girls who were Afghan refugees or in host communities, in Balochistan and KP, was launched in 2023.Digital solutions were employed to enhance the capacities for quality service delivery in middle level education. These solutions included the Sindh learning passport, supporting 4,700 girls in grades 7 and 8 to access the digital content in schools, and remote teaching on specialized subjects in middle schools benefitting 7,622 adolescents in Balochistan and KP. Young people‚Äôs engagement and skills were enhanced through innovation challenges, including the Living Indus Green Startup Challenge, Policy Research Challenge, Foresight Fellowship, ADAP Youth leadership training, GenU Incubation week, a regional adolescent workshop in Nepal, and participation in COP28. Identified challenges included the absence of sufficient data and evidence in the realm of skills development and blended education, limiting the assessment of requirements and the formulation of appropriate strategies. Moreover, the availability of trainers and facilities for various skills and trades emerged as a notable hurdle. While initiatives are currently being piloted in Balochistan and KP, these endeavors aim to provide valuable insights and adjustments before any potential scaling up.

This is also due to the fact that the amounts requested for financing are more modest than initially anticipated.

Furthermore, the Rights and Protection of Abandoned Child Act seeks to address the vulnerabilities faced by abandoned children, ensuring their rights and well-being are safeguarded. Simultaneously, the legislation concerning the Rights and Protection of Transgender Persons marks a progressive stride towards inclusivity, acknowledging and securing the rights of transgender individuals.  Recognizing the pervasive issue of sexual harassment, a robust set of laws has been introduced to provide comprehensive protection. These laws are designed to create safe environments, holding perpetrators accountable for their actions. Additionally, amendments to the Domestic Violence Act fortify legal measures against domestic abuse, offering enhanced safeguards and support for victims.  The amendment of the Labour Law reflects a commitment to fair and equitable employment practices.

To address this, OHCHR will provide a grant to a women-led NGO to support their programme aimed at empowering minority and Indigenous women in Cambodia, strengthening their capacities and agency while promoting a non-violent environment through the active involvement of families, including male relatives. Regarding international human rights mechanisms, OHCHR closely coordinates the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) recommendations and its implementation, including the ones directed at promoting and protecting the rights for women, children and persons with disabilities. In 2025, OHCHR will maintain active engagement with civil society, such as NGOs focusing on gender equality and LGBT persons, in relation to the UPR recommendations.

As part of the work under the LNOB principle and addressing inequalities, OHCHR will continue engaging with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) to advocate for their rights and consult them on the CRPD manual.

As we approach the 20th anniversary of the catastrophic event in 2024, it is crucial to educate and prepare the next generation, particularly high school students in Indian Ocean Member States who were born after the disaster. UNESCO is working to build the capacity of future coastal guardians through The Tsunami United Initiative. This initiative focuses on several key objectives: (1) Raise Awareness: Engage students in discussions about tsunami hazards and preparedness; (2) Connect Schools: Foster connections among schools in the Indian Ocean region; (3) Share Best Practices: Exchange effective strategies for tsunami preparedness; and (4) Encourage Collaboration: Promote cooperation among youth in the region.The initiative has successfully engaged 263 students and 117 teachers from 59 schools across 19 countries, including Indonesia, empowering youth for future resilience. Notably, students from Indonesia, including two female students from MAN 1 Banda Aceh and SMAN 1 Bayah Panggarangan Banten, participated in a live conversation with NASA astronaut Ms. Sunita Williams. This interaction sparked ideas and raised awareness about the importance of science and disaster risk reduction. In addition, 27 schools from 13 countries have participated in raising global awareness about tsunami preparedness, with two schools‚ÄîMAN 1 Banda Aceh and Lab School 1 UNSYIAH in Indonesia‚Äîreceiving notable recognition for their creative contributions. The Tsunami United Initiative aligns with national development plans and the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, emphasizing education, disaster risk reduction, and environmental sustainability. By fostering dialogue, sharing knowledge, and inspiring collaboration, this project aims to empower youth to effectively respond to future tsunami threats, building a resilient and united community, particularly among students in Indonesia. Through these efforts, the initiative not only prepares students for potential future disasters but also instills a sense of responsibility and community among the youth, ensuring they are equipped to contribute positively to their societies.

The campaign effectively raised awareness about skill-based on-the-job training, emphasizing apprenticeships as a key pathway to bridge the employability gap. This initiative contributes to strengthening skill ecosystems and fostering inclusive career opportunities for diverse and underrepresented groups.UNICEF-YuWaahIn 2024, 10.12 million young people gained access to job support, apprenticeships, and work opportunities, equipping them to pursue aspirational economic pathways. Notably, 56.34% of them were young women, marking a significant step toward greater gender inclusion in the workforce. The Step Up ‚Äì ‚ÄòBano Job Ready‚Äô program was expanded to support 1.9 million young people across India in identifying job opportunities, navigating the application process, and enhancing their employability. This was made possible through strategic partnerships with the Ministry of Labour  Employment, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Punjab Skill Development Mission, Pratham Education Foundation, and others. To further strengthen access to employment pathways, a month-long digital apprenticeship campaign was launched in collaboration with UNDP, NSDC, and the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. This initiative aimed to scale up apprenticeship opportunities by bridging critical information gaps on both the demand and supply sides. In partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), YuWaah introduced the Skill Innovation Challenge to identify and support groundbreaking solutions that enhance informal apprenticeships through digital transformation. Four winners were selected, each receiving USD 20,000 in financial support, along with technical guidance and global visibility for their innovations in skills development. Additionally, 6.22 million young people across India accessed career guidance and 21st-century skills, equipping them to navigate their personal and professional lives with confidence. With 49% of them being young women, our reach reflects a near-equal distribution, ensuring that both young men and women have the tools to shape their futures. Passport to Earning (P2E), a global initiative by UNICEF, is bridging the skills gap for adolescent girls and young women, particularly in peri-urban and rural areas.

By providing sexual health services to increase access and uptake of SRH services for men, the initiative aims to promote greater Male Involvement in Reproductive Health and improve reproductive health (RH) and gender-based violence (GBV) outcomes. This recognizes the importance of addressing men's SRH needs, contributing to more equitable access to services and improved health outcomes for both men and women. The initiative includes support for facilitating PDR and producing, disseminating, and monitoring policy recommendations in various areas, including reproductive health, youth and adolescent issues, gender equality, and harmful practices. By engaging multi-stakeholders such as policy makers, parliamentarians, religious leaders, and the media, the PDR aims to address gender disparities and promote gender equality through evidence-based policy dialogue and advocacy efforts. Capacity building activities are included to improve the management capacity of BAPPENAS in managing the knowledge hub. This capacity-building component acknowledges the importance of strengthening institutional capacities to mainstream gender equality considerations and ensure the effective implementation of gender-responsive policies and programs. The initiative supports advocacy efforts for the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action (PoA) through policy dialogues with multi-stakeholders. This advocacy component seeks to address systemic barriers and promote gender equality by engaging diverse stakeholders and advocating for policy changes that advance women's rights and empowerment. Overall, it addresses significant objectives related to gender equality and women's empowerment.

Although the initiative focuses on data compilation and analysis for evidence-based policymaking, there is limited explicit mention of human rights principles or frameworks. While it may indirectly contribute to the realization of human rights through data-informed policy decisions, human rights are not explicitly stated as a primary consideration. The initiatives does not indicate a direct utilization of normative frameworks or outcomes from treaty bodies or universal periodic reviews (UPR) to inform the activity. While the initiative aims to provide evidence for policy-making, it does not explicitly reference human rights treaties or mechanisms as guiding frameworks. It also does not specifically target patterns of discrimination, inequality, or marginalization. While the knowledge hub may indirectly address these issues through data analysis and evidence-based policymaking, there is no explicit focus on addressing human rights violations or systemic inequalities and lacks explicit references to rights holders or duty bearers with respective responsibilities and entitlements. While the initiative involves collaboration with government agencies, there is limited mention of engagement with rights holders, such as marginalized communities or civil society organizations advocating for human rights. While the initiative involves technical support to BAPPENAS and capacity building activities, there is limited mention of meaningful engagement with various stakeholders, including rights holders and beneficiary groups. The absence of robust stakeholder engagement reduces the likelihood of incorporating diverse perspectives, including those related to human rights. There is no indication of a thorough human rights analysis, including from a gender perspective, to inform the activity. While the initiative may indirectly address gender issues through its focus on SRH and gender equality, there is no explicit mention of a comprehensive human rights analysis.

Neverthless, understanding population dynamics, SRH issues, and gender equality can indirectly mitigate tensions and contribute to stability by addressing underlying socio-economic factors that often intersect with conflict. The initiative does not explicitly state that it's designed to be conflict-sensitive. However, by promoting knowledge management and evidence-based policymaking, it can indirectly contribute to conflict sensitivity by addressing socio-economic disparities and inequalities that can fuel conflict dynamics. The description outlines a clear theory of change wherein the establishment of a knowledge hub and the facilitation of policy dialogues aim to enhance evidence-based policymaking, particularly in areas related to population, development, and gender equality. While the description doesn't explicitly state how conflict drivers or root causes will be addressed, the initiative's focus on data-driven decision-making can indirectly contribute to peacebuilding efforts by promoting inclusive development and addressing socio-economic disparities.",-,richard makalew; Yori Novrianto,,1206145.0,599034.0,325416.0,241229.0,188071.93,165529.87,-,241229.0,153766.67,124413.12,-,241229.0,214186.63,164431.08,-,241229.0,207747.38,176855.44,-,241229.0,206807.32,194334.74,-,297333.0,240086.56,203997.86,"UNFPA has been supporting FKM UI to establish Knowledge Hub for compilation of KPs in areas such as population and development, SRH, adolescent and youth and gender equality in 2021.

It is initiated under the global partnership of UNICEF, Generation Unlimited, and Microsoft and Accenture on the Passport to Earning initiative, supported by a learning management system hosted on the Microsoft Community Training (MCT) Platform. A tri-partite led Young Warrior NXT initiative was launched, that will deploy large-scale life skills delivery solutions to support 14-24-year-old youth with foundational life skills. It targets 5 million youth in 2022, through 10-12 projects in partnership with life skills practitioners.  Currently, seven pilots have been shortlisted with an approximate reach of 90,000. 
Additionally, a chatbot-based solution reached 0.2 million in 2021, with 11 life-skills learning activities in 12 languages. This was done in response to adolescents missing socio-emotional learning due to online classes.The Youth Innovation Platform (UNIsolve) enabled young people to access age-appropriate content and tools on how to employ design thinking and social innovation to identify, investigate and solve for hyperlocal problems to drive social impact.   
The #YoungWarrior campaign, a youth-led movement to combat COVID-19,  triggered 6.6 million actions from 4.3 million young people. Young people have taken up actions such as capacity building, creating safe spaces and performing various tasks on U-Report such as learning how to counter misinformation or registering for vaccinations. New partners such as the Central Board for Secondary Education, University Grants Commission, and All India Council for Technical Education were brought onboard. The campaign brought together more than 1300 partners including various other Government partners. 
To engage the more marginalized constituencies of young people who do not have access to internet-enabled devices, YuWaah is also piloting low-tech and no-tech channels for engagement.

The Youth Parliament and the existing youth networks are used to combine aspirations of young political leaders and the needs of the community to address social inequalities and enable healthier and safer settings. The project utilizes capacity building and multi-stakeholder action towards community empowerment to drive a collective youth-led process for community-owned sustainable peacebuilding efforts.

The project developed 20 modules that were identified by NYSC together with the UN Agencies as crucial to orient and capacitate the participants on healthy settings, community development and volunteerism in-line with the overarching project objective of empowering young people in promoting health and wellbeing, volunteerism and collective action for promoting social cohesion. The modules utilize a participatory and problem-based learning approach with various hands-on activities to encourage participants to engage and interact. The programme is conducted in local languages to ensure equitable access.

The COVID 19 has impacted significantly on the capacity building trainings due to the limitations of ensuring impact on soft skill development components of the programme that relies of participant engagement to drive the peacebuilding outcomes. However, the project has incorporated an online Learning Management System as part of its design to ensure sustainability of the programme.

The aim is to provide catalytic support to the youth volunteer schemes of the Ministry (Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and National Service Scheme (NSS)) and facilitate greater youth participation and voice for peace and sustainability-oriented development programmes. Supporting the young women and men in realizing their full social, economic, and human potential, the project endeavours to help young people gain a strong sense of civic engagement and responsibility to transform their communities at large. Under the project, 1,162,621 (1.1 million) non-UN Volunteers were mobilized by National UN Volunteers in 27 States/UTs across India under a project to strengthen Government of India‚Äôs volunteering schemes - Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and National Service Scheme, implemented by UNV in collaboration with UNDP. These young volunteers were galvanized for civic actions through local level developmental initiatives around government schemes, financial  digital literacy, environment, health  sanitation, sports  wellness, women  youth empowerment, mental health, covid19 etc. More than 80 national and local level Civil Society organizations, Volunteer Involving Organizations, Governmental Departments and Agencies etc. in diverse sectors partnered with UN Volunteer for implementation of these developmental initiatives in many regions which are even hard to reach. The positive contribution of volunteerism towards the attainability of the SDGs and to Leave No One Behind has been the integral factor to empower, act and lead the youth towards nation building and self-development. Efforts led by National UN Volunteers in 27 states contributed to 33,820 young people, 44% of them women and 67% marginalized, being connected with career counselling  guidance, employment  entrepreneurship skills including 21st Century skills to create a productive workforce with focus on rural India under the Government funded project ‚ÄòStrengthening Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and National Service Scheme‚Äô, implemented by UNV in partnership with UNDP. The youth empowering activities included resume building, interviewing skills, information about various national and international scholarships, and competitive exam preparation. Trainings were also imparted on soft skills like personality development, leadership skills and design thinking. This further enhanced the UN Volunteers‚Äô skills, increasing their self-confidence and motivation to continue with their volunteering efforts as evident from the above-mentioned data of 94.4% of UNVs reporting their personal and professional skill development.

The youth have been engaging in a range of activities, guided by a team of trained volunteers like Ganga Praharis, Ganga Doots, and Ganga Quest to safeguard the natural diversity of the river. These youth volunteers encourage young people and those living in the area to take steps to protect the river from pollution and help conserve it. The volunteers connected the communities on importance of water conservation and rejuvenation of water bodies by providing details on available government programs, plans, and services related to water harvesting for a cleaner Ganga. Door-to-door campaigns, street plays, and wall art were adopted as a means to generate awarenessAs a part of institutional strengthening of volunteerism, UNV provided technical and knowledge support for the drafting of the National Youth Policy (2022-32) to equip the youth and policy makers with the tools and means to understand the scale, scope, and social and economic contribution of volunteering for development.",529000.0,361195.9,259318.48,-,529000.0,343628.99,277546.0,-,529000.0,423643.29,324690.42,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
