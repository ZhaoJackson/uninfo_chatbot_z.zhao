The initial location identified for installation of the washing and grading facility at Bopaththlawa was changed due to the identified land being mortgaged to a bank, which may result in ownership issues in the event of default of mortgage payments.

More than 406,000 Village Action Plans have been developed detailing costing, implementation schedules, OM, and source sustainability. UNICEF successfully advocated with the Government to integrate the certification of JJM outputs at all levels for all its schemes, not restricting to this year‚Äôs installations. Of a total of 125 districts reported to be saturated, 54 districts are certified. UNICEF focused on vulnerable districts in terms of socio-economic indicators, JE/AES spread and water quality affected habitations. There has been 5-fold (504%) increase in FHTCs in 117 remote and socio-economical backward districts from 2.43 million to 14.69 million; increase in FHTCs from 0.8 million to 13.20 million in 61 districts affected by Japanese Encephalitis/ Acute Encephalitis syndrome. In 50,000 water quality-affected habitations, safe water is made available through FHTCs. UNICEF also supported Ministry of Jal Shakti to conduct an annual functionality assessment of JJM schemes. Nationally, 86 percent of the HH tap connections were found to be working on the day of the survey. Out of these, 85 percent received adequate quantity, i.e., more than 55 Litres per capita per Day (LPCD), 80 percent had regular supply, and 87 percent had potable water. The intersection of these parameters of adequate quantity (&gt;55 LPCD of water), full regularity, and quality (potability) are taken to define the functionality of the HH tap water connection. The assessment finds that 62 percent of the HHs receive fully functional tap water connections within the premises. Key highlights from states include partnering with academic/research/engineering institutes/universities to extend technical assistance to PHEDs in building systemic capacities in planning, monitoring and supportive supervision for accelerated delivery of JJM, harnessing the ideas of young people in designing monitoring systems and the architecture for supportive supervision. In the government‚Äôs race to achieve the targets of household tap connection, UNICEF is ensuring that quality and sustainability is ensured through the process indicators.

A feasibility study on groundwater recharging options in rural water supply systems in different geographical and climatic zones was also conducted and informed the development of groundwater recharging models to respond to future climate change risks. Further, a guideline for the management of groundwater sources for rural water supply systems was developed by the National Water Supply  Drainage Board and translated into both local languages. Based on the research and fieldwork on water safety plan implementation, two knowledge products were developed, published and disseminated among local/international partners. The capacity of the National Department of Community Water Supply was enhanced to implement cost-effective models (48) on climate-resilient water safety and security plans in three climatic zones as pilot projects. Development Officers (60) and engineers (14) attached to this Department were trained on MAR (Managed Aquifer Recharge) methods applicable to rural water supply schemes. Two workshops were conducted to train Development Officers (50) on the implementation of water safety plans in rural water supply systems. Further, all plumbers (50) in the rural water sector were trained on reducing non-revenue water of drinking water supply as a climate-resilient intervention. Uva and Central provincial councils were supported to review existing national and local level policies and action plans to promote catchment protection of drinking water sources and to implement adaptation interventions to minimize the effects of climate change. Preliminary drafts were developed for further consultation. UNICEF supported preliminary data analysis of the national-level household water quality assessment which generated data for SDG 6.1. A consultative meeting with the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) was held on the next steps.

Following the project‚Äôs successes, the Government decided to upscale this approach in a $240 million worth programme directed at rural water supply and has requested technical support from UNICEF to expand the well-developed ‚Äòarsenic safe union model‚Äô to the new programme locations.   UNICEF provided supply items such as over 10 million water purification tablets (WPTs), 4,600 hygiene kits, and 49,000 jerry cans, etc. and supported the rehabilitation and construction of water supply systems and latrines along with hygiene message dissemination. A total of 1.7 million people (50 per cent female, 43 per cent children and 2.80 per cent people with disabilities) were reached. UNICEF also facilitated the procurement of 20 million WPTs for the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) through UNICEF supply and procurement section using government funding. Moreover, 340 WASH facilities i.e. renovation of water points and toilets in schools were undertaken with UNICEF financial and technical support.   UNICEF has been providing strategic and technical support to city corporations to generate evidence through city sanitation development assessment (CSDA), public hearings to develop city sanitation campaign strategy and materials, onsite sanitation compliance guideline development, structural assessment of onsite sanitation facilities, a business enabling environment for private sector and finally high level advocacy to the Government to improve city sanitation services as their high priority agenda.   In addition to financial support, UNICEF is providing technical support to the implementation of the SanMark project especially in the area of monitoring and mapping aimed at creating a database for easy retrieval of the information related to beneficiaries and trained local entrepreneurs for future use in expanding services.

Over 2023, an estimated 866,420 people benefitted from mobilisation and training activities through the project. Importantly, an extensive third-party monitoring programme carried out extensive follow-up visits to verify reported progress. In urban areas, UNICEF worked closely with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, respective city corporations and WASAs to identify multiple approaches to ensure the safe collection, transport and treatment options for mega cities, including low-income slum settlements. These multiple options include on-site sanitation; scheduled desludging and nature-based solutions, with the latter being piloted in Rajshahi and Dhaka in late 2023.  Over the course of the year, UNICEF supported the delivery of water services to more than 221,137 people, including emergency response. For sanitation, UNICEF supported the delivery of sanitation services to more than 94,630 people, including emergency response. In 2023, there were a number of extreme events, including cyclones and extensive flash flooding in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Cox‚Äôs Bazar. Importantly, UNICEF supported DPHE to deliver climate resilient WASH services to flood-affected households (with a double-platform structure) and climate-resilient sanitation services (raised latrine with a twin pit system), integrating experience from the flash floods in Sylhet in 2022.",6379500.0,4626519.83,3700819.62,"During 2024, UNICEF continued to work with national ministries and other partners to strengthen an enabling environment for WASH through the development and reviewing of key policies, strategies, and guidelines.

The provincial WASH development plans have now integrated climate resilience as a key area of focus. 
UNICEF advocacy in KP contributed to the approval of the drinking water act, finalization of the sanitation policy draft and revision of the drinking water policy to align with SDGs 6.1‚Äì2. The establishment of the KP Water and Sanitation Regulatory Authority was a major milestone. Following effective relationship-building with the KP Health Department, WASH indicators from health facilities were incorporated in DHIS. In Balochistan a timeframe for the sanitation policy was updated in the Strategic Plan, and the endorsed draft submitted for cabinet approval. Punjab allocated US$56 million for safe water for 5 million people in 2021‚Äì2022 and over US$600,000 towards PATS.

Government officials presented these successes, with UNICEF facilitation, at 10 international and regional platforms, demonstrating and strengthening government ownership and aiding in replication elsewhere. UNICEF advocacy and technical support led to over US$148 million leveraged for improved WASH services under Clean Green Pakistan during 2021 through three PC1s (government programme approval mechanism). 
UNICEF advocacy and technical assistance for survey and design of community water supply projects led to allocation of US$56 million in Punjab‚Äôs Annual Development Programme funding for 2021‚Äì2022 for the provision of safe drinking water in 1,000 villages benefiting 5 million people. The Government of Punjab also allocated US$600,000 to PATS. Government coordination leveraged partner capacities and the Multan Chamber of Commerce assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining filtration plants providing safe drinking water to the city‚Äôs 1.9 million residents.
Lessons learned: Following global guidance to shift the WASH programme towards climate-resilient WASH and the planned inclusion of climate energy and environment as a goal area in the new strategic plan, UNICEF began implementing SHIFT in Pakistan through WASH climate risk assessments in 2021. As this transition towards climate-resilient WASH progressed, it became increasingly evident that UNICEF must become a learning organization to better understand and leverage climate financing, understand the needs and challenges specific to the Pakistan context, and to engage effectively with the energy and environment sectors. This learning process will continue and accelerate in 2022, in the runup to the new country programme.
Constraints: COVID-19, high inflation and economic shock severely diminished the capacity of impoverished households to access sanitation services. UNICEF supported the poorest families by providing partial sanitation materials to construct toilets. This flexible response, with direct support to vulnerable communities ensured that programme targets were achieved quickly, and results were higher than envisaged

FAO engaged 113 government officials from the same departments to oversee and sustainable manage ground and surface water resources across the Pishin, Nari, Hingol, and Hamu-e-Mashkil river basins in Balochistan province. This inclusive approach bolsters resilience and ensures equitable, evidence-driven oversight essential for adapting to natural and climate-related risks.The following studies were conducted in close coordination with the Government of Balochistan, contributing to sustainable water management:1.    Mapping of Aquifer Recharge Zones in Four Selected River Basins: In collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), this study mapped aquifer recharge zones in the four selected river basins (Pishin Lora, Nari, Hingol, and Hamun-e-Mashkhel). It produced critical thematic maps to pinpoint areas of groundwater depletion and identify optimal zones for recharge. This study provides a strategic foundation for targeted groundwater recharge interventions across 32 selected watersheds.2.    Participatory Assessment and Improvement of Water Harvesting Techniques in Balochistan: Conducted with Water-Sprint Consultant, this assessment, evaluated and optimised traditional water harvesting practices, such as spate irrigation and karez rehabilitation. This assessment yielded comprehensive zone maps and strategic recommendations to maximise rain and floodwater harvesting, thereby supporting resilient water management and sustainable resource use across the province.3.    Assessment of Rangeland Resources in terms of productivity, services and functions: It covered 32 watersheds within four river basins of Balochistan.Under the GCF-funded project in Sindh and Punjab, a total of 133 participants (including 42 women) from water and agriculture institutions in both provinces were trained in Water Accounting (WA). These sessions focused on water supply, demand, accessibility, and usage, with participants expected to produce water accounting reports. Training sessions were conducted to enhance the capacity of irrigation and water management officials in both Punjab and Sindh provinces. Significant developments were observed in the Evapotranspiration (ET) Monitoring System, including the installation of weather stations and the launch of high-resolution ET mapping. Progress has been made in the development of the ACWA Information Portal, with the completion of a demo version and successful stakeholder workshops. Water Accounts are currently being developed and are expected to be completed by December 2024. Five (05) evapotranspiration (ET) Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) have been procured internationally, with FAO team providing a list of five (05) selected sites to the vendor. The installation of six (06) AWSs by the GCF project has significantly increased the availability of weather data availability. Additionally, flux towers that also produce weather data have been installed.

Strengthening water quality monitoring systems is crucial in Indonesia due to widespread faecal contamination together with the lack of a safely managed drinking water baseline. Following UNICEF advocacy efforts and in collaboration with WHO and the Ministry of Health, the first ever national drinking water quality survey in Indonesia was conducted, covering more than 20,000 household samples. This establishes an SDG baseline (16%) for tracking progress on national safely managed drinking water coverage. Further UNICEF data analysis support in collaboration with UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) to MOH helped finalize the national safely managed drinking water definitions, strengthen their SDG data analysis capacities and ensured quality baseline figures. The analysis also revealed substantial faecal contamination (69%) across drinking water source types. A two-page policy brief is under development to raise water quality issues among decision-makers, urging collective actions to strengthen water quality.
In support of the Government‚Äôs SDG-6 planning, a task-force team comprising four ministries and development partners has been established to develop safely managed drinking water target-setting, a costed plan and strategies. The safely managed water roadmap will integrate equity, gender equality, disability and climate resilience considerations while also elaborating on job creation and contributions to the economy. As part of safely managed drinking water strategy formulation efforts, UNICEF leveraged international and national research capacities to shed light on challenges and roles of non-piped drinking water and pathways to achieve the targets in collaboration with University of Technology Sydney and University of Indonesia. Sharing the research findings with line ministries and task-force team members resulted in stakeholders‚Äô agreement to incorporate non-piped drinking water strategies in the roadmap, which was overlooked before. A 
two-page policy brief is under development to widely disseminate findings and key recommendations to inform non-piped self-supplied drinking water.
To fill the knowledge gaps regarding adverse impacts of unsafe onsite sanitation systems on drinking water sources (i.e., self-supplied groundwater), analysis of SUSENAS data was carried out jointly with key line ministries including BAPPENAS, MOH, MPWH and BPS, and was published as an international research paper, formulating both drinking water and sanitation monitoring recommendations going forward. Fifty-nine proposals have been received under the INCUBITS platform (WASH innovation hub) offering solutions to addressing water supply challenges. These proposals are under review by a multi-stakeholder panel, with successful proposals benefiting from mentoring and networking support to implement their designs.
Towards fostering greater youth engagement and understanding safe water perceptions among young people, data collection through U-Report poll was carried out (with more than 2,500 respondents). The findings underscore the need to improve drinking water quality in schools (low trust), while also reflected their willingness to support awareness-raising on water quality issues. These findings will be used to inform youth engagement strategies in the water programme next year.
",292412.0,192757.3,166049.09,"UNICEF:During 2021, the first ever national drinking water quality survey in Indonesia was conducted with UNICEF support, revealing alarming levels of faecal contamination; with faecal matter present in 69 per cent of drinking water samples. In response to this survey, UNICEF supported the government in the development of a Roadmap for Safely Managed Drinking Water.  The Roadmap has been prepared under the leadership of a taskforce comprising of four ministries, as well as other development partners. The Roadmap includes target setting, a costed plan and key strategies for the achievements of targets as well as integrating equity, gender equality, disability and climate resilience. An important aspect of integrating economic dimensions, including job creation and business potential, has also been incorporated. The government is now planning to conduct a final consultation with all stakeholders to endorse the Roadmap. Based on this Roadmap, UNICEF will continue to support the government in ensuring safely managed drinking water across the country, aiming to meet SDG6 commitments on drinking water. The Roadmap not only emphasizes piped drinking water supply but also looked at non-piped drinking water strategies. Self-supplied drinking water is one of the important aspects which has been integrated into the Roadmap. A UNICEF policy brief on self-supplied drinking water has also been developed and widely disseminated. The policy brief outlines that 37 per cent of the Indonesian households rely on self-supply as their main drinking water source, with attendant high risks of contamination. If water quality risks are contained, self-supply could be a quick way to accelerate the safely managed drinking water target. Other actions recommended include a robust policy framework, community awareness and the professionalisation of service providers. With UNICEF support, the GOI initiated a national water quality survey with a sample size of 25,000 households. The survey has been analysed, revealing widespread faecal contamination in drinking water (69 per cent), resulting in just 7 per cent access to safely managed drinking water (as per the national definition) in Indonesia. This analysis highlighted the need to raise awareness on water quality issues as well as on safe sanitation among decision makers and the public in order to mobilize them for collective action. A UNICEF policy brief also has been developed and submitted to the government for their review and finalizationITU: KOMINFO as president of the Digital Economy Working Group of the G20 engaged ITU a global partner partiicularly to address the people-centred digital connectivity, stocktaking of the concept of digital connectivity, and a framework on digital literacy.

A national roadmap charting the course until 2045 neared its official launch, aligning with the country's broader development plans. The government received expert support in crafting a Presidential Decree to solidify its commitment to safe water and sanitation. Furthermore, a comprehensive SDG-6 Plan was drafted, encompassing all water and sanitation roadmaps, and paving the way for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health in upgrading health facilities in 12 districts across 7 provinces using a tool called ‚ÄòWASHFIT‚Äô. The WASHFIT program also built the capacity of health teams in 12 districts across 7 provinces with improved water quality monitoring and surveillance skills.On the global stage, with UNICEF support, Indonesia actively participated in the UN Water Conference, sharing its achievements, and shaping the Water Action Agenda. Additionally, the country played a vital role in preparing for the upcoming World Water Forum, leading discussions, and contributing to critical sessions.At the regional level, collaborative efforts yielded tangible results. A joint field visit to Surabaya and Sidoarjo districts informed the development of a targeted water quality monitoring program. Meanwhile, an assessment of water quality testing laboratories across 7 provinces revealed the need for increased access to testing kits and reagents.Turning to data and awareness initiatives, the year saw the completion of WASH Household profile book. A joint technical meeting with Bappenas and the University of Indonesia laid the groundwork for a comprehensive national plan to address water scarcity. On a local level, a district meeting in East Flores brought together district officials, including the regional planning agency, health and public works district offices, the water utility, the local disaster management agency, and the climatology agency to strategize and develop an action plan for tackling water scarcity in the region. As a result, the local government of East Flores has allocated IDR 2 billion to the anticipated risks of drought, particularly to ensure water supply availability in their respective areas.World Water Day 2023 provided a platform for raising public awareness about the importance of safe water. Through a collaborative initiative with Bappenas, a U-Report poll engaged over 3,600 young people in discussions about water access. Additionally, social media campaigns reached an estimated 650,000 individuals, highlighting the critical need for safe water and sanitation solutions. -----KOMINFO as president of the Digital Economy Working Group of the G20 engaged ITU a global partner partiicularly to address the people-centred digital connectivity, stocktaking of the concept of digital connectivity, and a framework on digital literacy.

A staggering 77.8 million children, which accounts for 88.2 per cent of the population, do not have access to safely managed drinking water. Additionally, 70 per cent of drinking water samples are contaminated by faecal waste, posing severe health risks. Furthermore, 3.5 million children are highly exposed to water scarcity, and eight provinces, home to 56 million people, experience high to severe water stress. In response to these challenges, the capacity of subnational governments to monitor and implement safely managed water supply was strengthened in three targeted provinces, successfully meeting the set goals. The National Safely Managed Drinking Water Roadmap was launched and disseminated, and efforts are underway to draft a similar roadmap in South Sulawesi. Advocacy for drinking water quality has been robust, with over 2,000 stakeholders, including national and local government officials, drinking water providers, sanitarians, laboratories, professional organizations, academics, private companies, and development partners, engaged through a national workshop. The development of RPAM was completed in four water utilities in Banten and Aceh provinces, significantly reducing the timeline from nine months to three. Additionally, the capacity of sanitarians to monitor drinking water quality was strengthened in Lombok Timur district and Surabaya city. Public awareness campaigns have also been effective, with WWF 2024 promoted through a U-Report poll with 22,000 young people, a webinar with over 150 participants, and social media outreach reaching an estimated 780,000 individuals. However, several challenges remain. Limited access to equipment, technology, and budget hinders effective routine water quality monitoring. Establishing an accelerated RPAM model for other districts and formulating robust strategies for scalable implementation is crucial. Enhancing local capacity for routine water quality monitoring and accessing budgets from various funding sources at the district level is also essential. Creating demand for safe water through innovative community campaigns to ensure household water quality is another critical area of focus. An initiative to integrate drinking water data, which is currently scattered across different ministries with no interoperability, has been initiated to address this issue.

Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement for the officers to have an updated knowledge on water safety plans. Considering this timely need, WHO supported to conduct three capacity building programmes for 150 officers working in the Central and Western provinces.  Some of the trained staff members participated at seven internal formal audits conducted in Monaragala, Vaunathivu, Himidurawa, Manar, Delft, Pitigala, and Udawalawa.  National Water Drainage Board rectified the gaps identified in external and internal audits.   Availability of WSPs has contributed to provide safely managed drinking water even during the COVID -19 period. Despite the significant progress in WSP implementation in Sri Lanka, new challenges have emerged requiring further expert assistance in the process of WSP implementation. WHO will be supporting to implement the climate resilient water safety plans to mitigate some new challenges.

UNICEF dedicated substantial efforts to the formulation of a comprehensive national framework for the Operation and Manual of Rural Water Supply schemes with a specific emphasis on effective management, governance, and enduring sustainability. This framework was circulated to states, serving as a guiding document for the formulation of state-specific OM policies. MoJS is planning to develop a comprehensive National Policy of OM of WSS, for which UNICEF was nominated as a member of the working group for further development. To expedite and maintain widespread capacity building support, UNICEF has supported training of 1,040 field level institutions like key resource centers and implementation support agencies at state, district, and sub district levels. This initiative aims to enhance the capacities of these institutions and provide guidance to village water and sanitation committees for more effective implementation of the JJM. Additionally, to reinforce the central level monitoring of capacity building endeavors at the grassroots level, UNICEF has facilitated the issuance of essential instructions to the states by the MoJS. Further, UNICEF has facilitated the visit of JMP team from New York for streamlining monitoring of safely managed water and sanitation in communities. As a result, Departments of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Health and Family Welfare and Education came on consensus to develop a WASH Dashboard which would provide information on WASH indicators, specifically safely managed water and safely managed sanitation at household level and schools/institutions level. Significant efforts have been put in place to strengthen the capacities of officials, laboratory personnel and communities on the importance of water quality monitoring and surveillance. A total of 503 state, district and block level laboratories have been facilitated for NABL accreditation along with enhanced capacity on monitoring of residual chlorine. UNICEF would continue to support NABL accreditation for water quality laboratories and focus on strengthening of modalities for community feedback loop for enhanced WQMS. UNICEF state teams have been providing core programmatic support particularly in WQMS. In Jharkhand, State Water Quality IEC Plan was developed from UNICEF with necessary budget allocation from Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DWSD), followed by statewide WQ IEC campaign. UNICEF‚Äôs field level interventions have also been notable. In Andhra Pradesh, guidelines have been developed for the execution of JJM through Self Help Groups (SHGs) and with handholding support from UNICEF, pilot project was taken up in 10 Gram Panchayats. Moreover, In Jharkhand state, one PRI representative from Ranchi district was awarded by President (Swachh Sujal Shakti Samman) for OM of water supply scheme, which was supported by UNICEF to develop as model for OM for water supply",2770967.0,2524099.46,2093502.2,UNESCO: Internvention targets government officials for capacity building ,2678546.0,2119138.86,1596845.43,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
