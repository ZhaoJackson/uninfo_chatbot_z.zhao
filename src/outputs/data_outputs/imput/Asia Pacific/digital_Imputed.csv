Through data assessment exercises conducted by IOM Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Regional Office of Asia and the Pacific (ROAP), several key challenges to applying an evidence-based approach to migration and mainstreaming in the country have been identified, including dispersion of policymaking actors across various government structures, limited use of migration-related statistics by government actors, limited awareness on migration governance, limited awareness on migration's impact on development and limited use of innovative sources of migration relevant data. To address these gaps there exists a need for a disaggregated and interconnected migration data to serve as an evidence base, for effective migration governance. Therefore, the project aims to work closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment and other relevant ministries to develop an integrated migration data platform to assist in development and/ or revision of migration policy instruments in the country.

It aimed to lay the foundation of knowledge which will help Indonesia to critically think about how best to design and implement a CDR system that would best suit their country‚Äôs needs. A grounding in the concept of CDR systems, together with a comparative analysis of the implementation of these systems in various jurisdictions, helped BPKN officers to draw out the lessons learnt from CDR in different contexts and identify best practices.
Outcome of the training workshop: Better understanding of needs, concerns, best practices and policy options for beneficiary countries implementing online dispute resolution for consumers, strengthened capacities on enhancing business-to-consumer e-commerce, in particular on dispute resolution for consumers, considering lessons learnt.
19 participants from BPKN attended the three-day virtual course and actively participated in the discussions. 68,75 per cent of attendees mentioned in the satisfaction survey that they ‚ÄúStrongly agree‚Äù with the following phrase: The training will help me to critically think about how best to design and implement a CDR system that would best suit my country‚Äôs needs.

Under the project technical assistance component, we are collecting information on national legal frameworks, interests and concerns regarding consumer dispute resolution and redress in Indonesia for a report on national frameworks for consumer dispute resolution and redress,
Outcome: New laws and policies implemented, and capacities reinforced to allow implementation of online dispute resolution for consumers, consensus emerges on implementation of such dispute resolution including for cross-border cases.
This is a medium-term outcome that would be evaluated at the end of the Project in 2023.

On and offline WeLearn training and coaching activities reached 4,020 women across Indonesia, receiving positive feedback and demonstrating enhanced capacities among trainees based on pre- and post-training surveys. Through the WeLearn trainings, women entrepreneurs increased their financial management skills for their businesses in three critical areas: (1) separating business and household bookkeeping; (2) calculating the cost of the goods sold; and (3) producing simple financial reports. In addition, based on the business checkup from the WeLearn training and coaching participants, these respondents acknowledged benefiting from WeLearn training with skills ranging from developing a business plan, financial management, digital marketing, business operations, and business legalities. During the project implementation, UN Women developed partnerships and worked in collaboration with government organizations, the private sector and donor-funded entrepreneurship programs to reach wider groups of women entrepreneurs for capacity buildings, build WeLearn awareness, and socialization of financial access for women entrepreneurs.

While in progress, an office-wide knowledge management strategy is under development. Effective utilization of collaboration site and ICON are also under discussion. It is to enhance cohesive use of the existing resources, further collaboration among programmes and operations, and visibility of UNICEF Mongolia. Lessons learned and innovations: Learning from the external relations, there is a clear demand to provide targeted communication and engagement to further strengthen UNICEF branding and awareness among the general public. Initiatives like Gala event and Children's Day celebration can serve as great entry points. Better visibiliy and cohesive branding efforts are to be strategized and enforced.

Together with Child.mn, UNICEF successfully called on media outlets to report on child rights issues, particularly on World Children‚Äôs Day that resulted in over 15 media reports, articles, and stories on air pollution, WASH, and child protection, reaching over 100,000 people.  Private sector engagement had‚ÄØsignificantly‚ÄØincreased in 2024, with 8 MOUs‚ÄØsigned to collaborate in areas such as CRBP, fundraising campaigns, customer engagement, awareness raising, and to promote mutual support between the organizations. UNICEF partnered with leading organizations such as Nomin Holding, one of the largest supermarket chains, and Shoppy, a prominent online shopping and ticketing platform that have committed to implementing CRBP. Given the size of these companies, the partnership opens up significant opportunities to advocate for children‚Äôs rights on a large scale.   Beyond working with the private sector, UNICEF has actively advocated for policy changes that support CSR and CRBP. UNICEF promoted a new change in the corporate tax law, which offers companies the opportunity to tax deduction up to 1% of their imposed tax if they spent from the taxable revenue on CSR projects. In collaboration with Khan Bank, UNICEF Mongolia brought together representatives from the top 100 companies to showcase UNICEF‚Äôs programs while providing information about potential collaboration opportunities. As a result, companies learned about the opportunity to implement CSR projects while benefiting from it financially and agreeing on future partnerships.   In partnership with government and NGOs, UNICEF increased youth participation in decision making through promoting skills development and youth-led advocacy projects.

In 2024, UNICEF delivered humanitarian assistance‚ÄØto 17 out of 21 provinces of Mongolia, assisting 27,840 children affected by dzud. UNICEF assistance covered underfunded priority areas of the Dzud Inter-Agency Early Action and Response plan, covering urgent needs in nutrition, child protection, education, WASH, and health sectors. UNICEF‚Äôs role as lead for sectors and sub-sectors strengthened through provision of continuous coordination, technical and fundraising support. 1,05 million USD was mobilized from various funding sources including CERF, UNICEF Humanitarian Thematic Funding and through local fundraising campaigns.   In 2024, UNICEF effectively coordinated with UNRC office, FAO and UNFPA to deliver holistic, multi-sectoral response to the urgent needs created by the dzud, filling critical gaps in Mongolia‚Äôs traditional siloed humanitarian approach. This approach included the distribution of multipurpose cash assistance (by FAO), enabling children to continue their education, combating malnutrition risk among pregnant, lactating mothers and children, and ensuring women‚Äôs specific needs.  UNICEF played an instrumental role in providing the technical, financial and managerial support in the operations of the country's largest‚ÄØhousehold survey process - the Social Indicator Sample Survey (MICS 7).

This system fosters connectivity among key rule of law stakeholders, promoting efficient collaboration among various entities involved in the justice system.UNODC is actively involved in the implementation of the Prison Management Information System (PMIS) in KP and Balochistan, with installations in 38 prisons in KP and 13 prisons in Balochistan. In this regard, 219 prison officials including 20 females were trained on PMIS. Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance collaboration between the Punjab Prosecution Department and Punjab Prisons Department, focusing on improving the Case Flow Management System (CFMS) and integrating it with PMIS. Moreover, the Case Management and Monitoring System (CMMS) has been initiated, further enhancing the digital infrastructure for efficient data governance.UNODC also conducted a targeted training workshop for 16 police staff members, providing them with essential skills to effectively utilize the specialized software implemented in the Smart Police Stations and Police Khidmat Markaz.Moreover, UNODC initiated the process of establishing four eLearning centres in each Provincial Counter Terrorism Department across Pakistan and the localisation of 10 eLearning modules on CT and gender-related subjects. 106 officials of the FIA including 70 constables, 28 FIA Inspectors and 8 Assistant Directors completed various online eLearning courses relevant to their agency‚Äôs mandate.",16476412.0,12103947.67,10170487.03,"UN Women will start Interventions in the next reporting year.UNODC: Justice sector institutions now operate with greater efficiency and coordination due to the enhanced Database Management Information System (DBMIS), which enables real-time situational analysis and automated processes.

As a result, 302 prison officials (21 females) have the technical capacity to manage prison data effectively, improving record-keeping, security, and inmate management. Additionally, 71 officials (15 females) in Punjab now have the skills to integrate and manage the Case Flow Management System (CFMS) with PMIS, ensuring faster case processing and better coordination between prosecution and prison departments.Police operations have been strengthened, with 37 officers (5 females) from Smart Police Stations now proficient in using digital case management systems, leading to greater efficiency in policing and crime data management.The judicial system has been modernized, with the establishment of six fully operational e-Courts (five in Sindh and one in Balochistan). These courts now facilitate secure and efficient remote testimonies, reducing risks for witnesses and expediting case proceedings. This advancement ensures that terrorism cases are handled more effectively, enhancing judicial transparency and compliance with international witness protection standards.Through these reforms, justice sector institutions now operate with stronger digital infrastructure, improved data management, and greater coordination, resulting in a more responsive, transparent, and technology-driven legal system.ILO is supporting National Statistics Offices to collect and analyse data to report on ILS reporting obligations including on gender indicators in the labour market like gender pay gap, measuring informal work.

This initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic has recognised the significance of e-commerce as a medium to conduct business and paved the way to be an important tool for women-led MSMEs to become part of the wider supply chain.Through the project, women entrepreneurs have access to online e-learning courses on e-commerce and digital marketing (https://unescap.wesellonline.org/elearning/), an e-commerce training portal (www.wesellonline.org) for women entrepreneurs, and a beginners manual on e-commerce and digital marketing (https://www.unescap.wesellonline.org/Ecommerce-manual/).As on 31 Dec 2022, 818 women entrepreneurs from South Asian countries have registered on Wesellonline and updated their product/service profile (352 from India). Additionally, ESCAP conducted a series of virtual and in-person workshops on e-commerce and digital marketing for women entrepreneurs that aimed to build the competence of female entrepreneurs, alongside the facilitation of networking opportunities and rreal-time support among fellow female participants through WhatsApp groups and Facebook groups(https://www.facebook.com/groups/wesellonline/about), with more than 1000 members in total, with majority Indians. A Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/wesellonline.org) has been established to encourage female entrepreneurs to share their entrepreneurial stories and products and services. In 2022, ESCAP has conducted a total of eight training, including six regional/national training and two online trainings for women entrepreneurs. For the year 2022, 703 women participants from South Asia and Africa benefitted from the training sessions, including 192 women participants from India. More than 2000 women participants from South Asia (including 572 from India) have benefited from the training sessions which integrated hands-on training on registering and linking their business to e-commerce platforms, networking opportunities, and hands-on support. These workshops also acted as a regional networking platform where women entrepreneurs showcase their products and services, thereby helping create regional networks.This initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic recognized the significance of e-commerce as a medium to conduct business and paved the way to be an important tool for women-led MSMEs to expand their businesses.

The original sub-output (SOU 7) aimed to enhance the knowledge and mechanisms of state and non-state actors to promote gender equality and integrate gender responsiveness at the national and local levels. The allocated resources for 2022 were $60,000, but only $20,000 was available, and the expenditure was $56,426. To address this inconsistency, the available resource amount was adjusted to $56,426.

The second sub-output (SOU 11) focused on the Royal Thai Government (RTG) acquiring knowledge on gender-responsive approaches to prioritize gender equality and women's empowerment in budgeting and procurement at the local and national levels. The allocated resources for 2022 were $10,000, with $5,000 available and $2,000 expended.

Now, these two sub-outputs have been integrated into a revised sub-output (Revised SOU 7). The revised statement emphasizes that state and non-state actors have increased their knowledge and mechanisms to advance gender equality and integrate gender responsiveness at the national and local levels. Additionally, it includes a specific focus on gender-responsive budgeting as a means to promote the prioritization of gender equality and women's empowerment.


The original sub-output statement (SOU 7): State and non-state actors have increased knowledges and mechanisms to advance and localize gender equality and women's empowerment  and to integrate/mainstream gender-responsive approach in their policy or operational framework at national and local level
