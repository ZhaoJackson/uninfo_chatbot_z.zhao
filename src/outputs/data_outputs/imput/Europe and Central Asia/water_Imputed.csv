The Kahriz is a traditional decentralized water supply system in Azerbaijan, which is fed through subterranean water. It has played a vital role in accessing groundwater extraction since ancient times in the arid zones of Azerbaijan. It is estimated that at least 1,400 Kahrizes exist in 20 regions of Azerbaijan. There is a growing recognition of Kahrizes as a nature-based solution and of the importance of rehabilitating them as an eco-friendly method for water extraction, especially in the face of climate change and water scarcity. In light of the above, the objective of this project is to contribute to enhanced water-related adaptation in the context of long-term impacts of climate variability and change in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The project will support government entities and project stakeholders to promote Kahriz rehabilitation as a climate change adaptation measure (Outcome 1) by making available evidence-based data and analysis promoting the rehabilitation of Kahrizes (Output 1.1) and by increasing the awareness and understanding of national stakeholders on the benefits of the Kahriz as a climate change adaptation measure, and equipping them to mobilize private investment (Output 1.2).",2024-01-01,2025-06-30,Implementation,-,-,IOM,International Organization for Migration,International Organization for Migration,Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources/Azerbaijan,"6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.",6 Clean Water and Sanitation,Azerbaijan,Data Collection and Analysis; Capacity Development/Technical Assistance,-,-,1 - Contributes to gender equality/women's empowerment in a limited way,,1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights,-,,-,-,-,-,,168805.0,168805.0,31195,84402.5,57687.57,53590.67,-,84402.5,61675.35,43798.33,-,84402.5,59392.62,42230.43,-,84402.5,57577.49,35915.87,-,84402.5,71876.05,52623.08,-,84402.5,74453.3,57104.45,-,84402.5,65485.86,55852.31,-,100000.0,69570.84,54569.92,-,68805.0,61165.99,45785.38,-,,,,-,,,,-

Considering the importance of clean water for populations in human settlements in conflict-affected areas, in humanitarian response and in the long-term perspective, UNESCO proposes the application of the UNESCO World Water Quality Portal for operational water quality monitoring in a Dnipro River Basin area via Earth observation satellites with the aim at helping Ukrainian people have insight into the quality of water of the Dnipro River and the reservoirs along the Dnipro River, which provide water supplies to major cities of Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv. Hence, the project provides vital information on the quality and safety of the water for the local populations and internally displaced persons relying upon for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene during the conflict.
The operational application of the UNESCO World Water Quality Portal in Dnipro River in Ukraine will enable water quality monitoring via the use of Earth observation satellites and in-situ measurements and as a result will provide valuable data and information on water quality of the Dnipro River and the reservoirs along the river.
