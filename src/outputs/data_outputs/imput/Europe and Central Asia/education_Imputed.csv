With the policy drift boosted by Ukraine‚Äôs EU candidacy and Biarritz Partnership framework, the gender equality agenda has gained momentum and finally received sufficient support from policymakers backed by UNFPA's technical expertise and continuous advocacy efforts. Being approved in December 2022 the Strategy is aimed at ensuring implementation of equal rights and opportunities for women and men, as well as prevention of and counteraction to any discrimination in the educational process at all levels through introducing changes in structural and organizational aspects.In addition to it, the UNFPA-capacitated technical expertise and advocacy resulted in adoption of methodological recommendations (—Åriteria) for carrying out a gender-sensitive anti-discrimination examination of textbooks. These criteria were approved by the Institute of Education Content Modernization on November 30, 2022 and set a basis for shaping a culture of inclusiveness and non-discrimination within the education system at all levels.  In 2022 to boost institutional capacities of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine on gender mainstreaming UNFPA facilitated the set up of the working group on equal rights and opportunities for women and men in education and accomplished the gender audit of the Ministry. The gender audit revealed areas for improvement and provided recommendations in terms of ensuring equal rights and opportunities in career promotion, decision making, establishing unified regulatory framework and staff training to address existing gender stereotypes.  From the capacity building perspective UNFPA created and trained a pool of trainers among education professionals in the methodology of social-emotional learning to ensure a sustainable effect of promoting anti-discrimination approach in education. SEEL (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) is an educational program developed by specialists at Emory University, USA, teaches methods of coping with stress and emotion management, and helps students succeed in school, in their careers and life.

Also, UNESCO supported 20 Inclusive Resource Centres with additional diagnostic tools (SAFA and MPR) and 40 specialists were licensed to use them. These diagnostic tools will help them diagnose a variety of developmental disorders in young children and youth, as well as war-related trauma, including learning disabilities. The 20 IRCs can provide diagnostic services to at least 140,000 children. ",8837331.0,7558406.5,6263097.97,-,,,,-,,,,-

UNHCR will also support the endorsement and fundraising efforts for the costed roadmap on educational inclusion, ensuring that financial and technical assistance is available to sustain refugee education efforts.

To facilitate effective learning and integration, UNHCR will support targeted Romanian language classes, literacy programs, and catch-up education, particularly for Roma children and other marginalized groups facing barriers to school enrollment and retention.

Individual implementation plans have been developed for each school to equip educators and students with resilience and soft skills to prevent GBV. The institutionalization of the SEEL methodology has been strengthened through the signing of the joint Memorandum of Understanding for the Development of Social and Emotional Skills in Children and Youth in Ukraine between the Ministry of Education and Science and other national partners. 2. Over 2023, UNFPA has significantly contributed to the implementation of the Objective 2 of the Strategy for Gender Equality in Education, specifically to its task #35 covering professional self-determination and mastering of professional skills in accordance with personal abilities and interests without limiting them to the framework of ""female/male"" and motivating girls and women to choose non-stereotypical STEM careers.This was achieved through  STEM projects ‚ÄúScience Ambassadors‚Äù, ‚ÄúOL Science Festival‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEcolab‚Äù in cooperation  with Lviv Open Lab and partnerships with local authorities, academia, youth spaces and civic partners.The ‚ÄúScience Ambassadors‚Äù project promoted gender-sensitive science popularisation among educators and helped them master digital teaching tools. It also assisted teachers in presenting themselves and their research effectively, especially for 390 high schoolers from vulnerable backgrounds. The project included a storytelling evening, ""Frankly about Science"", four videos highlighting women's contribution to science and gender-sensitive teaching, a methodological guidebook titled ""How to talk about science and yourself in it"", and a social media campaign covering 48000 people.The OL Science Festival featured innovative science shows and hands-on activities covering various fields. As a result, 4322 participants, including young people and families with children from Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Lviv, advanced their knowledge about gender stereotypes in science and were empowered with STEM opportunities in profession choice. On average, 36% of male participants improved their understanding of gender stereotypes, while 52% of girls acknowledged opportunities in science-related professions. ""Ecolab""  project intensive equipped 42 vulnerable young people  with green skills and knowledge to create an environmentally friendly, sustainable future.3. UNFPA has expanded its cooperation with the Ukrainian Education Hubs, a national network of lifelong learning programs focused on developing Ukraine's human capital implemented in collaboration with the Association of Innovation and Digital Education under the aegis of the Ministry of Education and Science. Apart from the support of Ternopil and Volyn Hubs UNFPA has developed and piloted a SCORM course, ""Career Alarm is Over!"" which incorporates storytelling, gamification, and interactive tests, and is available on the platform of the Ukrainian Education Hubs (https://bit.ly/scorm_course)- So far, more than 2,000 young people have completed the course, expanding their knowledge and opportunities to choose professions without being constrained by stereotypes.- Over 2,500 young people engaged in 48 training sessions focused on career guidance and STEM. Additionally, 1,075 high schoolers underwent career guidance tests, receiving personalized lists of sectors and professions aligned with their abilities.

In response to this call, UNFPA provided a targeted assistance to the Office of Deputy Prime Minister of European and Euro Atlantic Integration, Ministry of Education (MoES), Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoES), Institute of Education Content Modernization, State Service of Education Quality, Ukrainian Institute for Education Development, as well as to regional departments of education and regional professional development centers for educators in the following areas: (1) building an anti-discrimination expertise of the education content creators and experts, (2) support of young women and girls in a stereotypes-free career choices, specifically in STEM professions, (3) promotion of a zero tolerance to violence.
- To ensure a sustainable and catalytic effect of promoting antidiscrimination approach in education, throughout 2021, in cooperation with NGO EdCamp, UNFPA conducted 28 comprehensive online trainings for 1734 state educational content experts and representatives of the government agencies Institute of Education Content Modernization, State Service of Quality Education, and Ukrainian Institute of Education Development on non-discriminatory and inclusive approaches in education. At a more functional level, UNFPA developed an institutional partnership with the largest textbooks publishing house of Ukraine ‚ÄúRanok‚Äù, certified 43 textbook authors and experts after completion of a training program on creation of a discrimination free content, ‚Äã‚Äãand issued a guide for educators on non-discriminatory teaching. In line with regular trainings, UNFPA also started the development of a complex online course ‚ÄúEducation without Discrimination‚Äù which would soon provide a robust multidimensional instruction to educators on a harmful impact of stereotypes and means of creating a safe, diverse, and tolerant education environment.
- To embark a broader teachers‚Äô community on a dialogue about stereotype free education, UNFPA supported the organization of several massive international experience exchange and networking events, particularly a 25-day virtual professional development study tour to Sweden ‚ÄúEdMandry‚Äù for 1237 educators which got familiarized  with the specifics of Swedish education system, including the principles of a lifelong learning, project management and non-discriminatory approaches in teaching, and a multi-day National EdCamp Joy conference for 1161 educators which included 18 expert sessions from renowned researchers and community leaders and was dedicated to the tolerance and counteraction of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers‚Äô and students‚Äô mental health. As a result of these activities, more than 4000 educators improved their competence in applying an anti-discrimination approach in education and acquired theoretical and practical skills of eliminating stereotypes from the education process.
- Responding to existing inequality, UNFPA enforced its support to the national network ‚ÄúSTEM girls‚Äù which promotes STEM professions among girls and young women all over Ukraine. During 2021 UNFPA ensured that more than 10 000 girls had a chance to practice STEM and improve their chances to get profession in tech or IT sphere through organization of the national virtual celebration of the Day of Girls in ICT and the National Day of Girls in technology, supporting STEM Camp, the Hackathon ‚ÄúHack4Good‚Äù for high school female students and STEM challenges. STEM chapters coordinators received two 5-modules training courses on soft and communication skills to promote STEM chapters in their regions and three quarterly meet-ups, involving 118 coordinators. As a result of such an active engagement strategy, in 2021 STEM girls‚Äô network grew almost three times, increasing the number of its chapters from 31 to 118. The number of active members in the STEM Girls Community also increased from 1,263 girls to 1,513 girls.
- In 2021, UNFPA held its 4th in a row annual contest ‚ÄúBest gender sensitive STEM lesson‚Äù which aims to promote gender sensitivity of STEM lessons through integrated approach and innovative methods. 5 best lessons were acknowledged and recommended for application by the Institution of Education Content Modernization. 
- From a public awareness perspective, UNFPA promoted stereotype free career choice through engagement of high-level advocates and popular opinion leaders. In frames of the celebration of the International Women‚Äôs Day, the First Lady of Ukraine joined the UNFPA inspirational video about 5 Ukrainian girls who challenged the idea of stereotypical career choice and succeeded. The video reached over 119 000 views in social media and got 61 publications in the media. For youth and teens from the East of Ukraine, UNFPA provided an online training on stereotype free career choice through partnership with NGO Vostok SOS.

This learning crisis is further exacerbated by low preschool enrolment. While there was 6% increase in enrolment of children 3-6 years old, the current rate of 44% still falls considerably short compared to EU targets of 96%. To address this challenge, UNICEF actively advocated with municipalities to transform free school spaces into pre-school facilities as part of the optimization of school‚Äôs network initiative. Moreover, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and 21 municipalities to improve school readiness and early childhood development outcomes of Roma children, aged 3 to 6,by deploying Roma mediators in each of the municipalities to engage with parents of Roma children and facilitate early childhood enrolment and attendance. UNICEF engaged in extensive advocacy efforts that contributed to the submission of amendments to the Law on Primary Education, aiming to ensure that children in educational correctional facilities have access to certified primary education. This provision is intended to empower them to continue their education and acquire the qualifications necessary for future employment. While the amendment has successfully passed the first hearing in Parliament, it is currently awaiting final adoption. Additionally, on the children's takeover of Parliament, organised on the occasion of World Children's Day, allowed a highly visible opportunity for children and youth to express their concerns about the lack of access to and quality of education and to advocate for the fast adoption of the amendments to the necessary laws. UNICEF further emphasized these demands through letters sent to the Minister of Education and Science and Members of the Parliament. The Ministry of Education and Science's absence of feedback on the 2022 Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) strategy stalled the Bureau for Development of Education's (BDE) initial plan to introduce scaling up of CSE as a stand-alone subject in the 9th grade, impeding its implementation.UNFPA continued to work with and to support the BDE in other complementary processes - including participation of a national delegation at the regional CSE workshop in Sarajevo in August 2023, where different approaches and modalities were presented by countries that have advanced with CSE implementation. The lessons learned from the workshop, and the country context were further discussed, and  UNFPA supported the BDE in defining the modalities to integrate CSE topics into existing school curricula, as part of the ongoing periodic review and update process of the school curricula for various related subjects. Furthermore, UNFPA supported the BDE with mapping of relevant stakeholders and experts to assist the BDE in reviewing school curricula and incorporation of CSE topics. As the first step in the process, UNFPA will support the BDE in Q1 2024 with the reviewing of 7th and 8th grade school curricula for Biology (primary school),  where CSE contents would be integrated,  appropriate and in line with the UN International technical guidance on sexuality education.

In the course of 2022, UNFPA and UNICEF contributed to the development of the National Strategy on CSE (finalized in July 2022). This document is a prerequisite for scaling up CSE at national level, following the CSE piloting in 2021/2022, at 3 primary schools. The strategy was designed in a way to offer innovative approaches and solutions to CSE in the educational system. The strategy focuses on 2 main priorities: Improving the knowledge, skills and attitudes of students in the area of comprehensive sexual education and Increasing awareness of the need to study the contents of comprehensive sexual education in primary education. To facilitate collaboration among the Balkan countries Cluster, with support of the EECA Regional office, the UNFPA CO organized a sub-regional CSE workshop, entitled ""Championing young people‚Äôs health: a journey towards the wellbeing of the 8 billion"". The workshop created a platform for partnerships between the institutions working on CSE in the Western Balkans to strengthen CSE advocacy and implementation in the Western Balkan countries by sharing good practices and examples of modalities of CSE implementation by the main key actors and stakeholders from North Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, as part of the SRH portfolio and cooperation with the Macedonian Association of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, out-of-school CSE sessions have been delivered to high school students at several high schools across the country.UNICEFUNICEF continued supporting the implementation of the new Concept for Primary Education and curricula through capacity-development trainings for teachers. The transformation of the former special schools into Resource Centres that support the inclusion of all children in mainstream education was supported through capacity-development for staff and the development of various training programmes - a Programme for Professional Development of Education Assistants, a Training Programme on Alternative and Augmentative Communication and a Training Programme for Teachers Working with Refugee, Migrant and Asylum Seeking Children (the latter was drafted in 2022, but will be piloted and finalized in early 2023).In the lead-up to the Transforming Education Summit organized by the UN Secretary General, a series of 10 national consultations on the future of education were organized by UNICEF and the RCO, with over 600 youth, students, teachers, municipal officials, parliamentarians and CSOs. Based on the input from the consultations, a national statement of commitment was prepared and presented at the Summit in New York by the Prime Minister. Support for strengthening of the counseling and support role of pre-schools continued through mentorship and reflective consultations with the 20 parenting practitioners from preschools, who delivered parenting group sessions that aim to promote positive parent-child relationships and create supportive and nurturing environments for children. In 2022, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, UNICEF continued supporting schools facing WASH and IPC challenges. UNICEF continued collaboration with the tripartite WASH committee, of representatives from the MoES, Institute for Public Health and the State Education Inspectorate. As a result, 58 predominantly rural satellite schools received mobile handwashing stations ‚Äì effectively covering 8260 students. Additionally, technical staff representatives from these schools received specialized WASH training and helped advance the hygiene improvement plans of the schools. Finally, a thorough communication strategy was developed to tie IPC and WASH resources with school behaviors and practices conducive to safe environments",54860.0,40485.96,30672.92,"UNHCR - No substantial results in 2022. UNHCR was invited on meetings to providing advice and technical assistance in producing policies, documents for the education to become inclusive of refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons. Recognizing the importance of increasing learning outcomes, UNICEF advocated for and invested in the ongoing curricula reform. As part of this effort, the new curricula for grade six and seven was developed and UNICEF supported their alignment with the Primary Education Concept and with the national learning outcomes and assessment standards.To support the holistic integration of separate science subjects into one, as foreseen in the new concept for primary education, UNICEF supported the creation of an experiential learning programme focused on environment and climate change, that enables students to practically engage with the topic with their teachers and apply their knowledge. UNICEF also supported the Science Learning Network, comprised of six science institutions in designing and offering a joint educational programme on environment and climate change, aligned with national curricula and verified by the Bureau for the Development of Education. This programme, developed with financial support from Sweden, helps students acquire practical experience about the environment and natural phenomena and how our behaviour impacts eco-systems. To complement these efforts, raise students‚Äô knowledge of air pollution and support youth to get actively involved in processes at local level, UNICEF has also initiated the development of an experiential learning programme on air quality. UNICEF also established a partnership with the Vocational Training and Education Centre (VETC), initiating a greening revision of VET curricula, to support green skills development in students and facilitate the transitioning to a green economy. As of September 2023, all children with disabilities are enrolled in mainstream primary schools. One of the challenges schools are facing is to develop and implement the modified programme for working with children with moderate to severe learning disabilities. In response to this challenge, the Ministry of Education and Science established a collaborative working group with representatives from the resource centres, the Bureau for Development of Education, the ICF assessment commission, the body for monitoring the implementation of UNCRPD, primary schools and DPOs. UNICEF was invited to lead this group and to come up with recommendations for the necessary support required to assist teachers in developing and implementing the modified programme. UNICEF maintained regular meetings of the intersectoral steering committee tasked to oversee the entire Climate Change Education portfolio. This committee includes members of the Ministries of Education and Science, Labour and Social Policy, and Environment and Physical Planning. These partnerships extended on a technical level with specific units such as the Air Quality unit of the MoEPP, which is extremely beneficial for the sub-regional programme on Air Quality.To ensure system level support, a gap analysis of the services, capacities, and needs for providing mental health in education and social protection was conducted. The gap analysis results were used to draft the first National Action Plan for the mental health of adolescents in the country. UNICEF also led a group of professionals to develop a new counselling programme for parents and students adopted by the MoES. The programme primarily supports students who may display violent behaviour or, for various reasons, are not reaching their full academic potential. The school support involves focused efforts through individual and group counselling sessions with parents and students to overcome challenges and improve their mental well-being.UNFPA supported the data analysis of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study, and dissemination of the results at national and regional level. The national findings were presented at a conference organized by the project team at the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje premises, in the presence of numerous representatives of national institutions, relevant stakeholders, teachers, students, including Ms. Elizabeta Gjorgievska, spouse of the President of the Republic of North Macedonia. After the central conference, the dissemination of the results was initiated in all statistical regions within the country.Through the intervention, UNFPA set the baseline to create a platform for advocacy and promotion of youth wellbeing, addressing violence (including GBV), promoting constructive narratives, inclusion, and building trust among youth and their peers. By promoting findings, the rationale and need of integrating CSE in the educational process becomes even more evident, so that youth can receive age-appropriate credible information, to be able to undertake informed decisions about their life, health and their future.In partnership with the Macedonian Medical Association, UNFPA continued conducting educational-interactive workshops for high school students aged 15 to 18. Facilitated by a gynecology and obstetrics specialist and two actors, the workshops conveyed key messages: dispelling myths about sexual and reproductive health, promoting awareness of modern contraceptive methods and their benefits, underscoring the risks of unprotected sex, particularly regarding unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), emphasizing condoms as a readily available and dual-purpose contraception method guarding against both unwanted pregnancies and STIs, including HIV, and stressing the importance of regular gynecological examinations. More than 15 educational sessions around the country were conducted and were attended by more than 1200 students.

As a result of the progressive advocacy, the two bodies for functional assessments based on the ICF, covering the Skopje region, and the National expert body for functional assessment that were created with UNICEF support were taken over by the state healthcare system. Namely, the Public Health Center (PHC) Skopje, opened a new Service for functional assessment of children and youth up to 26 years of age, and from January 2021 it started with provision of regular assessments of children and youth from the Skopje region. In the period May-October 2021, with support from UNICEF, training and mentoring on ICF-based functional assessments was conducted in Pelagonija, Polog and South-West regions, involving almost fifty professionals. With UNICEF advocacy the PHC Skopje has engaged twelve of the persons whose capacity has been developed to staff three new regional functional assessment bodies in Strumica, Bitola and Gostivar. UNICEF also supported fifteen workshops to present the new model for functional assessment to service providers ‚Äì including Centers for Social Work (CSW), schools and kindergartens ‚Äì as well as parents in the three targeted regions.

UNICEF coordinated with line ministries and other relevant institutions the drafting of amendments to the Social Protection Law, Child Protection Law, Health Insurance Law, Healthcare Law and Primary Education Law in order to consolidate the provision of functional assessments for children and youth in line with the ICF. The amendments were approved by the Government and were put on the agenda of Parliament in December 2021.

While UNICEF has supported the establishment of functional assessment bodies which cover four of the eight regions of North Macedonia, children and youth outside the covered regions could not complete such an assessment and were thus not eligible to obtain access to educational and personal assistants. This resulted in difficulties in exercising their right to education, as well as problems in carrying out their everyday activities.

As part of the project, a training of trainers workshop was organized to consolidate the implementation of the program and ensure its more effective expansion. The social and emotional learning programme was consolidated, by expanding the pool of trainers and by focusing on the schools at highest risk of peer violence. By the end of 2023, over 34,000 children in 110 primary and secondary schools have benefitted from the programme.

Furthermore, the social and emotional learning program was further expanded to 114 schools, reaching almost 46,000 children.To improve the quality of education and care for Roma children in preschools, outreach visits to Roma settlements were organized and a set of trainings launched for preschool and primary school teachers in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science, and Innovation. By the end of the first quarter 2025, at least 90 preschool staff will have improved their capacity to support Roma children, and at least 700 teachers will be trained to use the MEIS based application for Early Identification of Children at Risk of Dropping-Out, as well as for the use of digital technologies in quality and inclusive manner.Also, in cooperation with the Bureau for Education, comprehensive activities are currently being implemented to improve the quality of educational services for children with disabilities in preschools and the first three grades of primary education.

In 2021  UNDP continued to support development of the institution and assist SASC with the swiss knowledge transfer activities for implementing the dual model aiming to transform existing supply-driven VET system towards a demand-led model to meet industry needs for the skilled workforce. 

UNDP VET project continues active partnership and collaboration with the governmental institutions and key stakeholders of vocational education in Georgia to support development of extension services for farmers. In 2021, UNDP was engaged in process of elaboration the New Extension Strategy of Ministry of Environmental protection and Agriculture of Georgia (MEPA) reassuring once more the commitment to promote quality of extension services to improve standards and mechanisms of knowledge dissemination accessible for small farmers. In the same vein UNDP contributed to launching digital extension platform http://regions.mepa.gov.ge in 4 regions for further national upscale, which would potentially reach 40% of farmers countrywide. This platform will contribute to increasing the volume and quality of the extension service provided in the regions, as farmers‚Äô queries will be directed to relevant specialized government agencies able to provide qualified advice. In parallel UNDP supported establishing Farmers‚Äô Extension Boards countrywide. By end of  2021, 21 operations Farmers Extension Boards are in place and functioning, including 3 new extension boards in Guria region that has been recently added to the pilot scheme. 

Under `VET College Development` component UNDP supported elaboration and formalization of 21 regulatory documents and authorized corporate standards for 8 VET-profile colleges. Additionally, 5 VET colleges were supported to elaborate their strategic documents.

UNDP VET project continues strengthening private sector service providers and educational opportunities for farmers.  Similar to other private companies and NGOs (Farmers school, Tabco, Akhazintercont, etc.) supported earlier, the newly established NGO `Qvevris Mze` was supported in elaborating educational training courses (STT) in winemaking using `Kvevri technology` in Kakheti region. 42 private companies joined PPP, including the `Work Based Learning` (WBL) scheme and are involved in the implementation process

As a supplementary contribution to improvement of livelihood of rural population, VET project supported acquisition and installation of 3 meteorological stations in 3 regions (Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Samtskhe-Javakheti regions). Access to more on-spot and precise meteorological data and prognosis will significantly improve farmers‚Äô efficiency to plan and conduct agricultural activities as well as informational exchange and communication among the local agri-communities.

Finally, raising awareness of wider population on environment and climate smart (green) agriculture was one of the direction of UNDP‚Äôs work in 2021. UNDP assisted Environmental Information and Education Centre` in elaboration of comprehensive educational module on `climate-smart agriculture`, which is designed for all agri-profile colleges and institutions at national level. In its efforts to popularize agriculture among schoolchildren children and youth, UNDP supported launching of `Agri-Clubs in 4 municipal schools of Racha-Lechkhumi region, which will provide children with general agricultural education and practical knowledge of gardening and other agri-fields from local farmers and agri-experts.

The VET Project supported the strategy development process together with other donors. Furthermore, the Project considered the priority areas of the new VET Strategy through planning the intervention areas for the next phase of VET Project. ¬Æ    UNDP continues its contributions to the working group on the new Extension Strategy Development 2021-2026 which is facilitated by the EU/FAO. The primary goal of the strategy is to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture sector in Georgia by delivering quality advisory services to farmers using modern digital and distance tools. This is to be achieved by strengthening RDA‚Äôs existing 54 regional and municipal Information and Consultation Centres (ICCs) throughout Georgia, into a more coherent, results-oriented, farmer demand-driven national extension service. ¬Æ   VET Project facilitated introduction of the FAO‚Äôs Farmer Field School approach to the Regional Farmers‚Äô Board in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region to identify needs and possibilities of implementation of joint farmer-oriented projects supporting sustainable agriculture in the region. Information and ideas of cross-team collaboration, available database and follow-up coordination have been discussed in the initial meeting steered by the Project‚Äôs regional partner.¬Æ   UNDP‚Äôs efforts for transforming VET governance system produced the following results: ¬Æ   Through the support to new VET framework implementation support activities, new authorization standards are in place and around,10 VET providers authorized in accordance with the requirements of the new regulations. ¬Æ   Under the College Development Fund facility, 7 new grant projects were approved and implemented. Overall, 48 private public partnerships formed exceeding the value of GEL 2,1 million and reaching 650 beneficiaries across the country via creating of short-term trainings programs addressing the need on a particular qualification and institutional capacity strengthening of VET providers. ¬Æ   Project facilitated further upscale of WBL concept in the country and in 2022, 18 new WBL students' capacity building and labour market transition was supported. ¬Æ   The project successfully continued to implement climate-smart and innovative micro-grants program for farmers and increased outreach to 142 farmers. ¬Æ   Regional interventions resulted in 13 active PPPs, over 21,235 farmers consulted, and 4,285 farmers trained in the second phase of the project supporting the extension system development in the target regions (Guria, Samegrelo Zemo Svaneti, Samtskhe Javakheti and Racha Lechkhumi Kvemo Svaneti). ¬Æ   Swiss Agricultural School Caucasus (SASC) delivered consultations for over 300 Farmers.   ",1170000.0,936800.55,677369.79,-,1845000.0,1407623.01,1053214.04,"  UNDP supported the transformation of the agricultural education ecosystem by advancing Work-Based Learning (WBL), public-private partnerships (PPP), and the representation of the private sector in the VET System. Further, the UNDP program assisted in enhancing the Performance Management System for VET Colleges by developing standards for VET principals and 360-degree evaluations allowing colleges to conduct digital self-assessments of their service quality. UNDP was instrumental in attracting and retaining young people in agriculture by assisting RDA in establishing and institutionalizing the new internship system for agriculture students at extension services. UNDP continued advancing the transformation of Georgia's agricultural extension system by assisting in the establishment of professional qualifications and the development of the pilot version of its professional growth system. UNDP nurtured a new partnership involving the Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture (MEPA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the NCEQE, the Business Association of Georgia (BAG), industry associations, processing enterprises, farmers, and non-governmental organizations which resulted in the development of a policy document on the Employment in Competitive Fields; this policy paper identifies deficient environmental and agriculture professions and outlines the government mechanisms for ensuring high-paying employment in these vocations. The document has been submitted to MEPA, and its enforcement into a Law is expected in the coming months. In 2024 UNDP achieved significant advancements in providing extension services to a total of 14,809 farmers, of whom 4,014 are women, across targeted regions, including Guria, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Ajara. Furthermore, UNDP facilitated services for 1,632 Agrarian Vocational Education and Training (A-VET) students, including 506 women, through both A-VET and Adult Education (AE) initiatives. Two notable contributions have been made towards establishing a Vocational Education and Training (VET) system that is more inclusive and aligned with labor market demands: (1) the implementation of an Ethnic Youth Integration Plan in two selected regions of Georgia, which enables 41 general education schools to offer VET courses tailored to ethnic minority communities and populations residing across the occupation line; and (2) the completion of a final draft for a concept regarding an institutionalized social inclusion fund. Additionally, comprehensive concepts focusing on the integration of NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) and ethnic minority youth have been developed, which will serve to guide institutions in enhancing access to both education and employment opportunities. To improve the inclusivity and accessibility of vocational education and training, particularly for rural and ethnic minority groups, the UNDP has undertaken several initiatives: a) the development of a revised version of the State Language Program, aimed at facilitating better integration and enhancing the social and economic engagement of ethnic minority youth; and b) the creation of a training package for Georgian as a Second Language (GSL), consisting of 60 audio files. UNDP assisted in enhancing Performance Management System for VET Colleges: the National Center for Education Quality Enhancement (NCEQE) has developed standards for vocational education and training (VET) principals, contributing to improved performance management in VET colleges. A comprehensive concept and digital tools for 360-degree evaluations have been developed, allowing VET colleges to conduct digital self-assessments of their service quality.UNDP also assisted in digitalization of the registration process for Sector Skills Organizations (SSOs) and training enterprises; implementation of a pilot blended training model for extension specialists that incorporates online learning resources; enhancement of the network of educators through the provision of online coaching sessions; formulation of a comprehensive concept aimed at the digital transformation of VET institutions, with a particular emphasis on developing digital infrastructure, enhancing management practices, and promoting innovative pedagogical approaches. Enrollment in Work-Based Learning (WBL) programs has tripled, reaching a total of 156 participants. Vocational education admissions have seen an impressive fourteenfold increase, totaling 35,457 enrollments. Additionally, the number of vocational education graduates employed in agriculture has exceeded expectations, with 595 graduates, surpassing the initial target by 1.4 times. Notably, the percentage of women benefiting from these programs significantly exceeds the targeted 30%. UNDP has made substantial improvements in the qualifications of teachers and extensionists, with 229 individuals (41% women) as extension officers and 117 individuals (77% women) as agricultural vocational education and training (A-VET) teachers. This development was facilitated through regular online quarterly meetings, coaching, and training in areas such as ""Lettuce Production,"" ""Demo Farming,"" ""Basics of Agricultural Cooperative Management,"" and ""Potato Production."" Furthermore, 47 field specialists and farmers (12 women) completed the training certificate requirements based on International Standards in Agriculture. UNDP has also achieved important milestones in developing examination requirements for dairy production and formalizing the application of the European Quality Assurance in Vocational Education and Training (EQAVET) indicators among VET providers. Additionally, progress has been made in implementing a Micro-AKIS concept in the Imereti and Guria regions. The development plans for the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in these regions, covering the years 2025-2030, have been completed and presented to stakeholders, with participation from 35 individuals (14 women) in Guria and 30 individuals (20 women) in Imereti. The UNDP has implemented effective interventions to support students, farmers, and vocational education and training (VET) institutions, helping them acquire the skills necessary for preparing business plans. In collaboration with the Swiss Agricultural School Caucasus (SASC), UNDP has introduced a work-based learning examination process and established an Alumni Support Fund to assist graduates in launching and managing agricultural businesses. As a result, three A-VET graduates have received financial support of up to $3,000 each to help kickstart their ventures. In order to promote agricultural education among youth, together with 20 educational organizations, UNDP provided Agro-scholarships to 32 students (including 14 women) in amounts of 500, 1,000, or 1,500 GEL. Another noteworthy initiative is the Agriculture and Environmental Protection Olympiad, held on the platform www.http://agroliga.veta.ge. This competition saw participation from 313 young individuals (146 of whom were women), from which 18 winners (10 women) emerged, each receiving various forms of rewards and recognition.  Extension services were promoted among youth by implementing and institutionalizing internships for vocational and higher education students at extension services, offering three-month paid placements. Namely, internship opportunities for vocational and higher education students were offered in six pilot regions in Georgia. More than 100 students will benefit from a three-month paid internship program. Moreover, UNDP has launched a new rural skills development initiative in partnership with the Pakka Foundation, focusing on field training and mentorship for farmers in organic hazelnut cultivation techniques in Kakheti and Samegrelo. To date, Pakka has trained 79 farmers (12 women) with the assistance of field advisers and international organic farming specialists, successfully testing six new techniques alongside farmers involved in demo plots. UNDP further supported increased representation of the private sector in the VET System: The agricultural Sector Skills Organization (SSO) AgroDuo has expanded its membership by enrolling participants from the meat processing and veterinary sectors while providing needs-based training for leaders, trainers, and specialists; and has continued to strengthen the foundational aspects of the skills hub concept which enhances the private sector power in the development of educational standards and programs.

Through small-grant program, 10 Georgian and South Ossetian women, 21 families or 82 members of the communities increased their monthly income and created services or products, which served more than 900 indirect beneficiaries from target communities and beyond. Young people from vulnerable groups gained better access to local job markets through undergoing digitalized VET courses offered by Sukhumi-based CSO National Resources and Tbilisi-based CSO Innovative Education Foundation. UNDP supported the economic empowerment of conflict-affected communities, including women by providing entrepreneurship training, mentorship, and in-kind contributions. 80 beneficiaries received training and grants for equipment to support their entrepreneurial activities.  Three road infrastructure repair tasks completed in Abkhazia have significantly improved access to public services for 815 rural residents (66% women). 88% also reported an increase in use of public services. This also significantly reduced travel time, cutting school trip for one community from 40 to 10 minutes. UNDP improved access to digital skills and STEM education for 300 young people in Abkhazia (60% female). This was achieved by providing spaces with IT equipment in the Sukhum/i Boarding School and Gal/i College of Humanities. Further 72 young people (82% girls) increased their employability by obtaining various IT skills through specialized trainings. UNDP contributed to improving access to quality healthcare services for rural conflict-affected communities. Six clinics were renovated and equipped with necessary furniture and medical equipment, including a full rehabilitation of the Ambulance and SES premises at Gali Hospital, rehabilitation works at the Polyclinic in New Athos, and Clinical-Diagnostic Laboratory in Agudzera in Abkhazia, as well as full rehabilitation of outpatient clinics alongside ABLs on TAT, Mejvriskhevi, Rike and Orsantia clinics. In total, around 45,000 conflict-affected people benefit from the newly renovated medical premises.  As part of the Referral Program, from January to September (including), 590 patients (401 women) from Abkhazia/South Ossetia received emergency or planned medical care on the TAT including the diagnosis and medication, and support with transportation and accommodation for patients and their family members.",1325000.0,1041757.31,773781.81,"  Throughout 2024 UNDP continued to provide access to essential social services, such as education and healthcare, as well as improving infrastructure for conflict-affected population.Healthcare: UNDP contributed to improving access to quality healthcare services for IDP communities. UNDP supported the establishment of a Day Hospital (emergency room) in Tskaltubo to serve the local and IDP populations, providing vital medical consultations and testing services within the community. This initiative has raised awareness of prevalent illnesses, symptoms, and treatment options among both IDPs and local residents, improving health knowledge and access to care. Enhanced healthcare services reduce barriers to treatment, contributing to a higher quality of life in Tskaltubo Municipality and potentially lowering morbidity and mortality rates. During the grant implementation period, a total of 1,850 individuals benefited. Of these, 415 were direct beneficiaries, including medical personnel, patients, and community meeting participants (103 men, 312 women, and 88 IDPs), and 1,345 were indirect beneficiaries, such as family members and potential patients (344 men and 1,001 women).UNDP organized activities as part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence in five IDP settlements. These included an information session with doctors, a Forum Theater for social change, and active engagement of IDP women in theater performances, all aimed at raising awareness about GBV, legal protection, and support services. The campaign mobilized IDP women and youth, promoting collective action and fostering a more equitable society. Throughout the mentioned activities, a total number of 227 beneficiaries were directly outreached and engaged.  As part of the Referral Program, from January to June (including), 178 patients (114 women) from Abkhazia/South Ossetia received emergency or planned medical care on the TAT including the diagnosis and medication, and support with transportation and accommodation for patients and their family members. UNDP also supported an umbrella network in the sphere of healthcare and support to PWDs which brought benefit to 278 (118F) vulnerable people, including PWDs and victims of gender-based violence. Results of 17 CSO grants provided by UNDP‚Äôs Civil Society Support Programme (CSSP) include: improving access to quality healthcare for 446 PWDs (237F, 209 M), including children, through services delivered at various rehabilitation centers across Abkhazia as well as psychiatric consultations for boys and girls; providing support to over 50 rural families living in extreme poverty to build their capacities to independently produce agricultural products in an environmentally-conscious way; socialization of 8 PWDs through one-day tours aimed at learning how to live a healthy lifestyle and appreciate nature, and; providing medical support to over 15 elderly people, PWDs and other vulnerable persons through outpatient medical service. Overall, in 2024, over 2500 conflict affected people were directly supported. Infrastructure improvements in 2024 entailed significant work carried out in IDP collective centers and conflict-affected communities. These efforts included bathroom repairs, water supply enhancements, and roof rehabilitation, benefiting over 1,082 internally displaced people living in 21 IDP settlements.  Through the EU4Dialogue project, 42 families in the Torsa IDP settlement regained access to safe drinking water. This initiative included comprehensive repairs to critical water infrastructure, reducing significant water loss and enhancing sustainable water access. Key improvements encompassed restoring water headworks and distribution pumps, installing tanks and filters, and conducting rigorous water quality testing. Additionally, community members participated in water hygiene training, and a village water committee was established to ensure ongoing maintenance and system sustainability. This project has effectively raised awareness of water safety and improved living conditions within the Torsa settlement, contributing to a healthier, more resilient community.  UNDP supported the water well construction in the Ingiri village IDP settlement, providing the IDP population with a reliable and systematic drinking water supply (110 IDPs - 63 women, 47 men, incl. 5 PwDs). Water pumping units and an extensive supply system were installed. Two local community members, selected to manage the water system, completed an intensive internship and are now qualified to operate the technical panel with safety and expertise. The initiative has resolved long-standing water access issues, eliminating life-threatening conditions and ensuring that residents can now live in accordance with sanitary and hygiene standards. Additionally, an extra pump was installed in the basement of the residential building to manage accumulated water, further enhancing living conditions for the IDP families. UNDP supported socio-economic and hygiene improvements in the Tsilkani IDP settlement by upgrading 11 cottage ceilings, installing solar water heaters and dryers, and training seven residents in sustainable energy management. These upgrades, benefiting 200 residents (124 women), reduced energy costs by an average of 28%, with a new energy cooperative established to promote local leadership in energy solutions. UNDP helped install a solar-powered bench in the settlement for internally displaced people in Senaki, offering renewable energy for mobile devices and a free Internet connection. The direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project already have the opportunity to use the free internet 24/7 in their settlement, through which they have maintained access to everything that they did not have before for example, they have learned to use Google, use various searches engines, which they actively use in their practice. beneficiaries included 1500 people, who used the free Wi-Fi during the initiative period.  UNDP has successfully supplied a low-maintenance incinerator for the Gali hospital including building a concrete platform and metal shelter to keep the incinerator secure. The initiative contributed to enhancing bio-medical waste management and environmental standards in Abkhazia. This advancement reduces infection risks within the hospital and provides Abkhazia‚Äôs medical and environmental sectors with a sustainable solution for disposing of bio-medical waste from various sources, including other hospitals and animal remains. These improvements contribute to the safety and quality of life for conflict-affected communities by ensuring better healthcare and environmental protection. Additionally, UNDP fostered personal connections between Georgian and Abkhaz doctors, offering promising potential for future cooperation. The incinerator benefited 350 patients (50% women) and is expected to serve thousands of beneficiaries over the coming years.  UNDP has provided the Nikozi outpatient clinic, located in an ABL village, with solar panels to address rising electricity costs and improve service reliability. As the clinic expanded its medical services, its operational expenses, including an annual electricity cost of approximately 3,500 GEL, also increased. Frequent power outages and fluctuations have affected the quality of medical equipment and imposed additional expenses, placing a burden on the clinic‚Äôs budget. The newly installed solar power system is expected to provide a reliable, uninterrupted power source, reducing electricity costs and ensuring consistent healthcare delivery. Serving around 5,000 residents in the Nikozi community, the clinic is the sole healthcare provider in the area, making this initiative vital to the well-being of local families and communities. UNDP has empowered marginalized populations in conflict-affected communities by offering access to business education, vocational education and training (VET) courses, and agricultural services. Namely, UNDP supported vocational handicraft classes for 54 women from ABL villages in Samegrelo, enhancing skills in knitting, digital marketing, and social media. Six women secured employment, and four are now conducting master classes in local schools, with six others obtaining grants to support their businesses. Additionally, technical equipment was provided to IDP settlements, enabling 90 women to become skilled in craft-making and promoting their work online to secure independent income. In the Imereti and Racha regions, around 270 (156 women) IDPs received training in business planning and funding opportunities, with 14 participants submitting applications and two successfully funded. Overall, UNDP through the EU4Dialoge project provided socio-economic and livelihood support to 1,831 people (1,121 women). These were vulnerable people including IDPs, rural and conflict-affected communities.  As part of VET support, digitalization and digital literacy was promoted through cross-district knowledge sharing: Sukhum-based IT trainers conducted training at Gal College of Humanities and Sukhum Boarding School, utilizing newly equipped IT classrooms. This initiative provided 44 VET students (24F) with essential IT skills, opening up future career paths in a technology-driven world. Additionally, 32 VET teachers (all female) enhanced their ICT literacy, empowering them to better support student learning. This grant underscores the transformative role of technology in education, equipping youth with skills vital for career development and adaptability in a digital age UNDP enhanced the skills of 19 (3F) young people from remote areas of Abkhazia and TaT by introducing advanced agricultural techniques and smart rural technologies. This included providing smart devices to help automize and improve greenhouse production; thus, increasing sustainable income for target rural groups in Abkhazia and TaT UNDP facilitated access to higher education for 9 (6F) conflict-affected youth residing in Abkhazia to study in France and Estonia.

Based on the technical recommendations of the international experts and the work of the appointed working groups, the curricula for teachers and methodologists have been reviewed and revised from 144 hours into two training pathways: a 100-hour in-person program and a 72-hour online course. The in-person program uses hands-on methods for child-centered learning, managing diverse classrooms and promoting social and emotional growth with big emphasis on practical implementation. The introduction of the online courses will give flexibility through digital tools for easy access. Over 25,700 teachers are currently using the Learning Passport platform and the new curriculum was approved to start implementation from 2025. The syllabi for the new curricula are being revised and developed accordingly and will be finalized by the beginning of the courses to start in 2025. Curriculum development for pre-schools Directors. In alignment with the Cabinet of Ministers‚Äô Resolution #531, which mandates enhanced leadership training for preschool directors, new certified managerial courses were developed at the request of the MOPSE. UNICEF provided technical support in the development of the curriculum for Directors for 144 hours through the review and analysis of their managerial, pedagogical and motivational competencies and needs necessary to lead well in a fast-changing environment.  The curriculum was approved and is being pretested in December for full implementation starting January 2025. ",640000.0,525346.15,455590.07,-,,,,-,,,,-

In Uzbekistan, UNICEF partnered with ICP to engage young volunteers, adolescent girls and boys in ten selected target schools from Tashkent and Termez cities, Chirchiq, Yuqorichirchiq, Kasansai and Bulungur districts in community DRR, climate change adaptation, disaster preparedness, and comprehensive school safety. Three-day training seminars were organized in Tashkent and Samarkand for 45 teachers from target schools in two cohorts on 21st-century skills, time management, stress management, DRR and climate change. Furthermore, ICP organized five training seminars for 232 (125 boys, 107 girls) adolescent girls and boys, members of newly established School DRR clubs in each target school for engaging in community resilience and school safety, including search and rescue operations and first aid. 125 volunteers of RCSU, in turn, supported the School DRR Clubs to conduct simulations and drills on how to act in emergency situations. Finally, the trained teachers and RCSU volunteers organized seminars on youth engagement and action planning for the school DRR club members. As a result, the schoolchildren from the School DRR Clubs in the target schools engaged in community and school observations, interviews with teachers, parents and community members, and reviews of school preparedness plans. The School DRR Club members developed their school hazard profiles, drafted action plans to improve disaster preparedness, and showcased them to the school community members.Shock Responsive Social Protection: Support the development of coordination, governance, financing, and/or programme design for social protection in emergencies in all five Central Asian countries. In Uzbekistan, UNICEF supported the government to strengthen preparedness of the national humanitarian and social protection systems to respond to shocks through several activities. This includes: (1)  Updating an assessment of the national system‚Äôs readiness to activate emergency cash support protocols to reach affected households. The assessment has been accomplishing using the CADRI Social Protection Assessment tool with a combination of desk review and key informant interviews. The final report suggests on potential opportunities, barriers, and detailed recommendations (along policy, programmatic, systems, and related dimensions) for improving the delivery of humanitarian cash transfers in Uzbekistan. (2)  in-depth review of the legal system pertaining to humanitarian and social protection system. In particular, the review presents results of exploration of existing national legislation and concrete recommendations in regard the amendments required for the social protection system to be able to scale up cash assistance as part of a national humanitarian response. A validation workshop has been conducted in participation of key stakeholders to present preliminary findings and recommendations of above two assessments as well as to collect feedbacks of national partners in regard prioritising the further steps based on feasibility and importance.(3)  Training Workshop on Scaling Up Emergency Cash Transfers in Response to Emergency Situations has been conducted for government counterparts in Uzbekistan during the period of 17-19 July 2023. More than 25 key staff representing 16 ministries and agencies, responsible for humanitarian response in case of emergency situations participated in 3-day training. The training was adapted to local context and was articulated around a series of applied thematic sessions, which exposed participants to practical operational issues when designing and delivering emergency cash transfers through the national social protection system in response to emergencies. (4)  Initial assessment of the role of cash transfers and other social protection responses to climate-induced heatwaves has been conducted, considering that it is one of the biggest hazards in Uzbekistan. According to UNICEF‚Äôs Children Climate Risk Index, 9.6 million children under 18 are exposed to heatwaves in Uzbekistan or 91% of the children. In the context of climate change, the severity, duration, and intensity of these events are expected to increase, impacting the lives and livelihoods of millions of children and their families. Yet, globally, the linkages between shock-responsive social protection, including using cash transfers as a response mechanism, are under-researched. In this regard, data collection has been conducted, which was followed by a rapid literature review and development of a report looking at the potential role of cash transfers in response to climate-induced heat waves and recommendations on the ways forward.

A gender review of the Inclusive Education (IE) Strategy was conducted, with recommendations integrated into the document. In addition, a legal provision to establish inclusive education resource centers was developed and submitted to the MOE. Four educational standards for pre-school and secondary education, criteria assessment of early complex assistance, and translation of publications into accessible formats were also established to ensure consistent and quality implementation of inclusive practices across educational institutions. Methodological materials covering career orientation for children with disabilities and recommendations on how to conduct flexible assessments of student‚Äôs knowledge and skills were developed.UNICEF in partnership with the Republican Institute of Professional Education and the Belarus State Pedagogical University updated educational standards, curricula, and pre-service training programmes for student teachers. Becoming a mandatory training for all student teachers from September 2023, these programmes will ensure that all future educators are equipped with knowledge and skills for inclusive teaching. Two new methodologies on inclusive education practices will be integrated into curricula for special education students, who are being trained for work in resource centers for inclusive education, psycho-medico-pedagogical commissions, and early complex assistance services.

Around 4,500 teachers improved their capacity to work with children with disabilities and special education needs through these programmes. In cooperation with the national partners UNICEF supported the development of an educational program on professional orientation for children, including children with disabilities. The programme will be used as an elective course in educational establishments to support children in choosing a future career and planning necessary steps thus improving opportunities for realizing their potential and further employment.UNICEF developed an e-tool for assessing accessibility of educational establishments for children with disabilities. Another needs assessment was conducted in 118 pilot educational establishments to understand the needs of children with disabilities and special educational needs in modern assistive equipment and technologies. Based on the results of the assessment the CO provided over 350 children with disabilities with assistive devices. Both assessments will allow to better understand barriers faced by children with disabilities and children with special educational needs when accessing the mainstream education.A National Inclusive Education Forum was conducted jointly by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF.

Following UNHCR's advocacy efforts, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Innovation agreed to propose an amendment to the Law on Recognition of Foreign Diplomas and Qualifications. This amendment acknowledges that refugees cannot always obtain all the documents necessary for the recognition of foreign diplomas as required by regular procedures. The new provision will ensure that the rejection of an application for the recognition of foreign educational documents and qualifications cannot be based solely on the absence of official documents proving a certain foreign professional qualification. This change aligns with the Law on International and Temporary Protection of Foreigners. The adoption of these legal changes is expected in 2025.
Consequently, the Ministry of Education has started collaborating with the Council of Europe to determine the manner of establishing qualifications and skills for refugees who do not possess the respective educational certificates (prior test).

UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health is supporting 5 PHCs in the 5 cities where the vast majority of the refugees live. Thus far the PHCs organized training for all PHC on health services and entitlements for the refugees and piloted breastfeeding counselling centres in the 5 municipalities. The PHCs have also produced and disseminated information material for parents on the Montenegrin immunization calendar, breastfeeding and breastfeeding counselling centres, and on the Bebbo mobile app for parents. The PHCs have also introduced an online feedback mechanism for refugees using the UNICEF data collection platform InForm.  776 refugees were supported and provided with primary health services with UNICEF support to the Ministry of Health and 5 primary health centers focusing on the following priorities: Strengthen the knowledge and communication skills of healthcare workers for working with refugees. Facilitate the communication of refugees with the health system Facilitate the access of refugees to health care, with a special emphasis on the care of mothers, babies and small children. Facilitate the identification and overcoming of possible difficulties that may arise when refuges are accessing health care through mechanisms for providing feedback in Ukrainian and Russian languages.  Through support coming from UNICEF, Institute for public health of Montenegro has intensified work on strengthening HIV/AIDS testing services on primary health care level as well as treatment and clinical management on secondary and tertiary level of health care.

The cooperation with NGO Dobro Djelo, enabled UNICEF to be in direct contact with the affected population with focus on women and children which contributed to a more inclusive overall refugee response.  UNICEF supported ukrainian NGO Dobro Djelo to organize non-formal education support and inclusion activities such as : course on sexual education; chess classes, basketball trainings for children; tennis group trainings, Christmas event (500 guests); music concert;)  Since both gender-based violence and human trafficking are forms of violence, in which the perpetrators use a series of manipulation techniques, the victims themselves are often not even aware that they are victims. That is why, the UNICEF supported NGO Womens Right Center designed the brochure ""There is a Way Out"", which provides knowledge about these issues. The brochure has been translated into Ukrainian, Russian and English, which makes it accessible to a large number of migrant and refugee women.

In 2023 UNFPA will continue implementing the out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) program. This initiative will follow UNFPA‚Äôs International Technical and Programmatic Guidance on Out-of-School CSE and will focus on reaching adolescents and young people in rural areas, those with disabilities, and youth from the left bank of the Nistru River.
In 2024, the initiative aims to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment where all young people, regardless of their background, have access to comprehensive sexuality education and essential resources for a healthy and informed future. To achieve this, several institutions and organizations working with youth will be equipped with dedicated spaces for non-formal sexuality education activities.
Additionally, civil society organizations, particularly those in underserved regions, will receive support to enhance their capacity in promoting young people‚Äôs sexual and reproductive health and rights. Specialists from various organizations will be trained to deliver accurate, age-appropriate education on these topics, ensuring that young people are well-informed and empowered.
Furthermore, parents and caregivers of adolescents with disabilities will be provided with the necessary knowledge and resources to support their children‚Äôs development and smooth transition into adulthood.
In 2025, UNFPA will continue strengthening civil society organizations and youth networks across Moldova, including those on the left bank of the Nistru River, to develop and implement programs on sexual and reproductive health and rights tailored to diverse youth groups. To support these efforts, UNFPA will create guidelines for delivering youth-friendly health services for vulnerable youth, aligned with international out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (OOS CSE) standards.
A digital training program will be introduced for facilitators working in CSE, ensuring they are well-equipped to provide accurate and effective education. Additionally, new educational and interactive materials, such as the Diary of an Adolescent Boy/Girl, will be developed to make information on sexual and reproductive health and rights more accessible and relevant to young people. 
Building on UNFPA Moldova‚Äôs expertise in youth well-being and global best practices, and in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) and the Youth National Agency, UNFPA will establish the Future-Ready Hub‚Äîa pioneering space dedicated to life skills development, innovation, and modern technologies.

In this context, five thematic studies, as well as ‚ÄúEducation Sector Review in Armenia‚Äù have been initiated on general education (including pre-primary level) and will be completed in 2022. The ESPDG process triggered a transparent policy dialogue between the MoESCS, developmental partners and key education stakeholders, and will influence the upcoming national education sector strategy. 
In close collaboration and discussions with MoESCS and NCET, the e-module on the assessment and registration of preschool and school-age children with special education needs (SEN) was tested. It is planned to have a separate Module within the Educational Management Information System (EMIS), to be used for coordination and evaluation of the services, and for information exchange with the health and social protection sectors.

As a result of UNICEF support, the document is equipped with a solid evidence base that informed key decisions and directions within the Programme; it enjoys good consensus among actors of the education sector and beyond; and it will be accompanied by a costed action plan to ensure effective implementation.  Comprehensive education sector assessments and reviews are not a common practice in Armenia. Usually, education system‚Äôs analytical work is fragmented and scattered in different documents. With UNICEF support and continued partnership, MoESCS finalised and released five thematic studies and the Education Sector Review report, a comprehensive evidence base used to inform reform efforts. The process was highly participatory and aimed at establishing a systematic approach for education sector analysis, enhancing the quality of education sector plans, budgeting as well as to ensure regular joint education sector reviews. The various components of the plan are consistent between them and with government-wide strategies and international commitments, including the pledge made by the Government of Armenia at the Transforming Education Summit this year. The Government is likely to face challenges in mobilizing sufficient financing to implement the strategy. Implementation and monitoring a large number of activities and indicators is another challenge. The costed action plan under preparation with UNICEF support is expected to mitigate those risks and improve operationalization.There is a persistent teacher shortage, especially in rural and remote communities, and the shortage is likely to become even more acute in the nearest future. The Education Sector Plan notes that 46% of teachers are over 50 and only 11% under 30. According to 2022 university admission results, few young people selected teaching as a profession. Thus, replacement of retiring teachers is a concern that MESCS is addressing by scaling up a new incentive scheme through which teachers can earn higher salaries if they successfully engage in a voluntary certification process based on new professional standards. This provision is based on the recommendations of the UNICEF-supported study on teacher deployment whose findings were discussed with the ministry. The National Center for Education Technologies through E-School Armenia scaled up the online mentor school model for online teaching and learning earlier developed with UNICEF support. The initiative allowed to identify and use the potential of highly qualified teachers and schools.In response to children‚Äôs needs arising from recurrent escalations along the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan and other tensions of geo-political nature, special attention was given to education continuity in safe and enabling environments. In five schools and three kindergartens in Syunik region, UNICEF and partners provided healthy lifestyles and hygiene education, and repaired WASH facilities ensuring gender and disability aspects are duly considered. Eight schools received new school furniture and UNICEF learning and recreation kits. Children from Nagorno Karabakh stranded in Armenia due to the Lachin corridor blockage received school bags and stationery to support their temporary placement in schools in Armenia.",300408.0,205165.89,170989.76,"UNICEF continued its collaboration with MoESCS and partners around the ongoing education reforms becoming a partner of choice in the education sector. UNICEF contributed to policy dialogue by supporting national consultations for the 2023-2026 Action Plan (AP) adjacent to the State Program for Development of Education until 2030 (EDP), which was adopted in late 2022 with UNICEF support. The AP defines clear targets, and timeframes for implementation and was approved in March. The European Union chose UNICEF to act as technical assistance agency for the implementation of the EU Budget Support, which covers a significant part of the budget required for the education sector reforms until 2026. UNICEF initiated the Education Joint Sector Review for the first time in years, which will contribute to improving the monitoring and accountability functions. UNICEF produced an Education Budget Brief and conducted the Education Sector Plan Appraisal that provided key recommendations that informed and influenced various reform decisions with consideration of gender and disability. System capacity, including the capacity to effectively monitor the ESP implementation and coordination are recognized as critical issues by both reports. The reports also highlight the importance of investing in datasystems for better planning and implementation of education programs. They recommend investing in EMIS to enhance scope and coherence of data collection between education levels and to enhance disaggregation by disability, gender, age, and other parameters. Partly because of this and previously generated evidence, MoESCS recently introduced a new management model of public educational institutions separating educational and administrative-economic processes, an approach that should lead to a clearer distribution of duties and responsibilities. A new funding formula for public education institutions was initiated and will be implemented in 2024. UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry and CSO partners contributed to strengthening the teacher professional development system, which this year has involved an increased number of teachers in voluntary teacher certification. In 2023, certification was held in all subjects, and those who do not work anywhere, but have a pedagogical education, were allowed to participate. This move was coherent with the recommendations of the UNICEF 2022 analytical report that advises reconsidering the standards and the content of voluntary certification making it attractive to more teachers. UNICEF supported teachers‚Äô forums and conferences contributing to professional development opportunities, sharing best practices, and promoting pedagogical innovations. ",428000.0,328586.97,254506.15,"The MoESCS sustained education reforms despite the significant challenges and uncertainties that Armenia and the wider region have faced in recent years. 2024 was an important milestone as the country reached the midpoint of the Education State Programme's 2023-2026 Action Plan (AP). In this framework, UNICEF‚Äôs analytical work, high level technical assistance, field-level engagement, and capacity development initiatives have comprehensively contributed to advancing education reforms.Under the budget support agreement between Armenia and the European Union (EU), UNICEF provided technical assistance to the MoESCS to enhance quality and equity of education services, through improved coordination, monitoring and enhancement of professional competences. UNICEF in collaboration with the MoESCS initiated a joint sector review (JSR) of the education sector to discuss the progress of the reforms in January 2024. This review aimed to discuss the progress of reforms and its findings were presented to development partners and education stakeholders during the first high-level policy dialogue held in Armenia under the EU's budget support agreement with UNICEF technical inputs, a newly established platform of regular policy dialogues that contributes to greater accountability and joint monitoring of the situation in the education sector. Subsequently, these discussions informed a revision of the key targets in the 2023-2026 Action Plan at the end of the year. Overall, it was noted that while Armenia has made significant progress in enhancing educational content, improving professional competencies, changing teaching methods, student assessment and evaluation approaches, and creating child-friendly learning environments through initiatives like the ""300 Schools and 500 Kindergartens"" programme. At the same time, there are also challenges that require further attention. Some of those issues are related to refugee children from Nagorno-Karabakh, integration of out-of-school children, enhancement of educational leadership, and early childhood education.In response to the refugee influx from Nagorno Karabakh, UNICEF continued to support the MoESCS in accommodating and effectively including refugee children in Armenia‚Äôs education system, focusing on areas where the system has been mostly overstretched by the additional number of students. In order to expand learning spaces in schools with high concentration of refugee children together with children from host communities, 65 classrooms in 22 schools from Kotayk, Vayots Dzor, Ararat, Armavir and Gegharkunik regions were provided with school furniture and educational supplies. 5,155 children have received learning materials, including school bags with stationery. 8,072 refugee children have accessed remedial education and MHPSS services. In order to address psycho-social needs of refugee and other vulnerable children, UNICEF in collaboration with UNESCO initiated a partnership with the Republican Pedagogical-Psychological Support Center (RPPC) to enhance Mental Health and Psychological Service (MHPSS) in schools focusing on social-emotional learning, psycho-social resilience building, and creating a safe environment for children to learn and thrive. A training program on MHPSS in schools and a manual for building psychosocial resilience in children was developed and piloted. This resource helps educational staff create a supportive learning environment. As a result, 690 school psychologists and 362 teachers improved their skills in providing effective MHPSS services to children.",420285.0,309339.27,246617.45,-,,,,-,,,,-

To operationalize the implementation of the Law on Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted in 2021, major legislative reforms are ongoing for alignment of sectoral policy frameworks with UN CRPD. Several policy papers were also developed based on the fundamental principles of the Convention such as the social model of disability, the procedures for reasonable accommodation in educational institutions, revision of the funding formula for inclusive education and minimum standards for physical accessibility of all preschool and general educational institutions. This process is supported by UNICEF in collaboration with other UN agencies, to enable the transition to the new disability assessment, certification, and to initiate a service delivery nationwide pilot in 2023. With UNICEF technical assistance, MoLSA developed several regulatory acts to operationalize the legal framework for the reform of Disability Assessment System and introduce the Functional Assessment of Disability taking into due consideration child-related aspects. Specific interventions include the revision of the disability assessment/certification and individual service provision planning procedures, updating the list of Assistive Technology (AT) addressing the needs of children throughout their lives and across settings such as home, school, and community. A set of assessment tools for 4 age groups and 7 types of special educational needs (SEN) assessment were developed and piloted among preschool/school age children with the purpose to make the SEN assessment more measurable, accurate, and informative. The new Individual Educational Plan (IEP) was tested for both preschools and schools and proved to be more user-friendly. With UNICEF support, MESCS modelled the Special School for children with hearing impairments as a Resource Center. Progress was also made in enhancing operational features of e-disability and the SEN module of the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in order to enhance data collection on children with disabilities and their participation in school. As a result of UNICEF policy advocacy, an action plan aimed at enhancing the quality and accessibility of inclusive education services as well as ensuring inclusion starting from early year at preschool level was adopted by the Government. Through partnership with the Republican Pedagogical and Psychological Support Center (RPPC), the pedagogical-psychological support system for children with special educational needs and children with disabilities was strengthened.Along with the reforms, cooperation and partnership with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs), NGOs and international organizations was prioritized by the Government and resulted in more participatory processes and consultations for developing inclusive strategic papers and projects for persons with disabilities.

UNICEF also contributed to the strengthening the new disability assessment and certification scheme, by costing the setup of one testing unit in the Unified Social Service USS) and equipping it with assistive devices, by building the capacity of multidisciplinary assessment teams (including health, social and education/developmental professionals) and by contributing to the development of an e-disability information system. UNICEF also provided technical support in generating country-specific evidence on ecosystem to support access to assistive technologies as well as on assessment of child disability. Both aim at supporting policy development to enhance functioning, participation in learning and social inclusion of children with disabilities from early years through adulthood. UNICEF in collaboration with UNDP and UNFPA continued to promote adherence to UNCRPD principles and the advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities. UN agencies stimulated the engagement of persons with disabilities in national development mechanisms and supported the enhancement of the capacity of Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPD). UNICEF‚Äôs cooperation with OPDs promoting the rights of children with disabilities and underrepresented groups resulted in the establishment of a platform for regular consultations on disability issues and validation of legal and policy reform documents, and disability service models.

These provisions will enable children with disabilities to receive tailored support that helps them function optimally in daily life, enhancing their ability to participate in educational and social activities. In addition, progress was made in the policy dialogue related to disability-inclusive social protection and services, a topic that was discussed at the two-day international conference titled ""Towards a World without Barriers: Accelerating Implementation of Disability Inclusive Social Protection"" organized in Yerevan by MLSA in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, GIZ, UNDP, UNICEF, and UNFPA. The conference reviewed progress and addressed ongoing challenges related to disability-inclusive social protection and services in the region and globally.The CO continued its partnership with the Republican Pedagogical and Psychological Support Center (RPPC) in strengthening the pedagogical-psychological support system for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The focus was on enhancing SEN assessment, service provision and monitoring. The CO invested in ongoing teacher training through introduction of the Interpersonal Communication and Community Engagement to Support Inclusion training package. Trainings for trainers were conducted in all regions of Armenia for 244 specialists (242 women, 2 men) from 12 regional pedagogical psychological support centers.The MoESCS approved an action plan and schedule for reorganization of the special general education institutions (https://www.arlis.am/documentview.aspx?docid=192158). This is an important milestone towards a more operational environment for including children with disabilities and with special educational needs in mainstream educational institutions. UNICEF provided technical assistance for the development of the resource center charter and for piloting the transition from special school to mainstream school with a group of 15 students with hearing impairments. The Resource Center for Children with Hearing Impairments will officially start operating in September 2025. UNICEF supported the development and publication of 6 methodological manuals aimed at increasing the efficiency of inclusive education and improving professional skills of pedagogical workers involved in this process. The CO provided didactic materials to 25 regional chapters of RPPC, including bags with assessment tools for mobile teams to provide services to students in educational institutions within their catchment area.In 2024, UNICEF delivered targeted disability inclusion activities as part of the refugee response in partnership with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPD), including SOURCE Foundation, ‚ÄúHavat‚Äù NGO of Hard of Hearing Children‚Äôs Mothers and Lady Cox Rehabilitation Center, the latter being a refugee-run OPD that UNICEF supported also in adjusting to Armenia‚Äôs operational environment. More than 300 refugee children with multiple disabilities received needs-based and specialized support, developmental and rehabilitation services, MHPSS, assistive technologies, and humanitarian assistance.Awareness-raising activities included producing video reels on topics related to children with hearing impairments, validating best practices and lessons learned from two assistive technology models, and organizing a two-day workshop on ""Access to Services for Persons with Disabilities.""

UNICEF in close collaboration with MoESCS and MOTADI, identified the target communities for establishment of early learning services in 2022-2023, guided by the provisions of the Law on Preschool Education and the 2021 Action Plan on Implementation of Inclusive Preschool services. As of December 2021, 15 communities have initiated renovation works, 3 of them have already finished, the rest will finish in the 1st quarter of 2022. It is expected that, overall, 289 children in rural underserved communities will gain access to preschool education services. 
UNICEF continued advancing early identification and intervention practices. Specifically, the training module and practical guide on ‚ÄúBasics of Early Identification and Intervention‚Äù for doctors and nurses was tested in Amasia health center and was accredited by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia. Several legal documents were developed/finalized to enable the provision of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services for children, including the Follow up Growth Charts for children with cerebral palsy to be used by primary health care workers; the follow up of neonates with developmental risk factors; antenatal screening of Alpha-fetoprotein. Finally, the early identification of developmental delays/ disabilities and intervention policy framework has been revised. Early identification of children with developmental delays is critical in the early stages to facilitate early intervention for maximizing the developmental potential of children, and improving outcomes for children, families, and communities.
The provisions of the Law on Pre-school Education started to be implemented in 2021. Specifically, 2021-2023 Action plan for making all preschools inclusive was adopted, state budget was allocated for establishment of alternative pre-school services. The draft of preschool education standards was developed and are at the final stage of public review. The Government program for 2021-2026 targets establishment or renovation of at least 500 kindergartens and preschools by 2026, ensuring furnishing and equipment.
UNICEF Armenia provided technical assistance to selected communities in defining the terms of reference and recruiting the educators for the preschool services, training and mentoring of selected educators for 15 early learning centers and building the capacity of the staff of reference kindergartens to further support the newly established alternative preschool services and provide them with methodological guidance thus ensuring the sustainability of the initiative.",880000.0,692919.09,641979.69,"With UNICEF continued support, the policy framework, infrastructure and technical capacities of service providers continued to be strengthened to ensure all young children have access to quality and inclusive preschool. The enrolment of children in preschool institutions (public and private) during 2021-2022 school year increased (32.3%) in comparison with the 2020-2021 year (24.3%). This can be considered an indication of positive trends also due to continued efforts to invest and prioritize early childhood education, although enrolment rates still remain lower compared with the pre-COVID situation (34.7%) and inequities between rural and urban areas remain. Despite some improvement in enrolment rates including in rural areas, the limited number of preschools remains a key bottleneck with children in approximately 200 rural settlements missing the opportunity for early learning due to the absence of pre-school services.  Hence enlargement of the network of preschools remained a priority in the 2021-2026 Government Programme and the new ESP. In this context, as a result of the tripartite collaboration between UNICEF, MoESCS and MOTAI, 256 children (out of them 130 girls) 3-6 years old benefited from 15 operating alternative early learning centers in rural settlements, and around 400 parents learnt about holistic child development and upbringing. Young women from those rural communities were trained to work as teachers, which contributed to establish sustainable solutions for the functioning of the preschools, besides contributing to their income and empowerment. During renovation access to clean water, and energy efficient measures were considered. The preschool buildings were equipped with solar photovoltaic system to ensure access to renewable energy systems. Outdoor playgrounds were established close to the early learning centers to ensure outdoor activities of children. Simultaneously, another 10 rural settlements were supported by the state-budget to establish alternative preschool education services. The training module and practical guide on ‚ÄúBasics of Early Identification and Intervention‚Äù for primary health care staff were included in the List of accredited training for in-services continuous professional development. The Concept on Early childhood intervention and rehabilitation services for children was developed with UNICEF support and is awaiting approval by line ministries (MoESCS, MoLSA and MoTAI). Subsequently, they will become the basis for the development of the Action plan for strengthening early identification of developmental delays and disabilities, early intervention and follow up. Early identification of children with developmental delays is critical in the early stages to facilitate early intervention for maximizing the developmental potential of children, and improving outcomes for children, families, and communities.  ",900000.0,726937.16,583989.78,"UNICEF continued to advocate and provide technical assistance for strengthening policy frameworks, infrastructure, service providers‚Äô technical capacities, and data systems to ultimately ensure all young children have access to quality inclusive preschool. The number of preschool facilities, including nursery-kindergartens and pre-primary classrooms in schools, grew by 10%. The enrolment of children 0-6 age group in preschools increased to 36% during the 2022-2023 academic year compared to 32.3% in 2021-2022. This can be attributed to continued efforts, also supported by UNICEF, to invest and prioritize early childhood education. Preschool network expansion remains a top focus in the ESP. In this regard, UNICEF, MESCS, and MTAI continue close collaboration. In 2023, UNICEF increased the number of alternative preschools in remote settlements to 40 by establishing 9 new facilities. The expansion of the network of the alternative preschools contributed to the gender equality in the country by empowering particularly women caregivers to get engaged in income generation and community life thus increasing the use of the full talent pool of the population and to enhancing women‚Äôs economic independence. 518 children 3-6 age group (45% girls, 55% boys) in remote settlements benefitted, and 600 parents learned about holistic child development. State funding was provided for the establishment of alternative preschools in 3 more rural settlements. Access to, gender-sensitive WASH facilities, energy efficiency, and climate resilience measures were considered throughout the refurbishment process, including installation of photovoltaic systems. To ensure outdoor learning activities, playgrounds were established near alternative preschools. 80 young women from rural settlements were trained to become preschool educators. 2,134 children (45% girls, 55% boys) in 23 state kindergartens functioning as resource hubs for alternative preschools benefitted from additionally capacitated staff and improved furnishing.Financial mechanisms to enhance mainstreaming inclusion at preschool level have been introduced nationwide. Furthermore, several provisions were approved to set standards and better regulate the provision of services, including the preschool education program for each age group, regulations on selection of preschool educators, mandatory in-service training requirements and the list of required furniture and equipment. A two-day national conference on preschool education was held with UNICEF support, involving 300 teachers, administrators, academics and other practitioners, who learnt about new regulations and developments and discussed the way forward. This first ever experience of this kind has the potential to create a platform that brings together different experiences and enables greater ownership over the ongoing reforms among practitioners. Despite significant improvement in preschool enrolment rates, the lack of preschools continues to be a major bottleneck and became more evident with the arrival of refugees in September.  In this context, through a collaboration between UNICEF, MESCS and local authorities, a mapping exercise of preschool facilities in areas of high concentration of refugees was initiated to identify priority communities where facilities and services need to be expanded. UNICEF also initiated a partnership to expand the capacity of early learning services by establishing 20 fully equipped preschool classrooms. To strengthen the system‚Äôs capacity to early identify children with disabilities or special educational needs and include them in preschool from the beginning 325 primary health care doctors and nurses (97% women) accomplished accredited Training on ‚ÄúChild development and early identification‚Äù. Child development assessment kit was developed and distributed with Posters ‚ÄúRed flags Early identification guide‚Äù to iPHC sites covering 13% of 0-5 children population.",845000.0,741302.05,510863.12,"UNICEF continued to support the operationalization of the Law on Preschool Education, enhancing policy frameworks and service providers' capacity to provide quality inclusive preschool services. Despite advancements in the enrollment rates for children 3 to 5 years old, enrolment for children below 3 remains extremely low at 4% and policy dialogue between UNICEF and MoESCS led to the important decision of piloting new mechanisms to expand coverage.Despite improvements in enrollment rates, the limited number of preschools remains a key bottleneck contributing to inequities between rural and urban areas (46% urban, 24% rural). A differentiated approach was taken to address the lack of preschool education in around 200 rural settlements, with tailored solutions.The enlargement of the preschool network has remained a priority in the 2021-2026 Government Programme. In this context, as a result of close collaboration between UNICEF, MoESCS, MOTAI, and local self-government bodies, 5,685 children (47% girls, 4% refugees) aged 2-5 benefited from the services of 50 kindergartens and 37 alternative preschool education facilities refurbished and equipped with soft furniture and didactic/learning materials.Through parental education sessions, around 400 parents learnt about nurturing care, holistic child development, caregiver-child positive interaction, importance of early learning, healthy nutrition, and pediatric diseases.Investment in preschool staff capacity development remained a key priority, featuring enhanced training and more structured communication. The MoESCS and UNICEF organized the second National Conference on Preschool Education, offering a valuable and ongoing strategic forum for 600 preschool practitioners to engage in discussions about recent developments, challenges, and future directions. This initiative acts as a mechanism for improved accountability and systematic monitoring. In addition, 230 preschool educators built their capacity through training modules developed based on international best practices covering: positive parenting; inclusive pedagogy; disaster risk reduction; psychological first aid and trauma-informed practices with young children and their caregivers. In 10 preschool education facilities, expansion of learning spaces was initiated to expand access for refugee and host community children. Renovations integrated considerations related to access to clean water and energy efficiency.1,500 preschool educators have benefited from state-supported continuous professional development, while 26 educators have received formal qualifications, with these processes continuing to evolve. In collaboration with UNICEF, new training modules focusing on positive parenting and psychological/psychosocial first aid have been developed and submitted to the MoESCS for integration into these professional development programs. 360 children aged 5-6 from refugee and other vulnerable families, including children with disabilities/developmental delays benefited from a one-month course implemented in 20 schools, to reach the state-defined standards necessary for successfully mastering the school curriculum. The related education package developed by UNICEF in collaboration with MoESCS and CSOs, is considered for potential expansion to help prepare more children without preschool experience for school entry.""Let‚Äôs Play Activity Cards - Play-Based Activities for Healing and Learning"" originally created by International Step by Step Association (ISSA) have been translated, adapted and introduced for caregivers and parents by UNICEF and a national CSO.

The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that educational materials align with principles of inclusivity, diversity, and gender sensitivity.The examination involves a meticulous review of educational materials, including textbooks, teaching aids, and supplementary resources. The emphasis is placed on identifying and addressing any elements that may perpetuate discrimination or lack gender sensitivity. The goal is to create an educational environment that is inclusive and reflective of diverse perspectives.The presentation of the analysis results is scheduled for April 2024. This presentation will serve as a platform to disseminate key findings, highlight areas for improvement, and emphasize the importance of fostering an educational environment free from discrimination and inclusive of gender perspectives. Stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and curriculum developers, will be invited to participate.As a critical outcome of the project, recommendations developed within the framework of the analysis will be integrated into curricula and teaching methods. This proactive step ensures that the impact of the examination goes beyond identifying issues to actively contributing to the enhancement of educational content and methodologies.The implementation of the recommendations is expected to follow a carefully planned timeline, allowing educational institutions and policymakers to incorporate the changes seamlessly. The gradual integration will foster a more sustainable and widespread impact on educational practices.UNESCO's collaboration with the National Academy of Education in conducting an anti-discrimination and gender-oriented examination of educational materials represents a significant commitment to fostering inclusive and equitable education.
