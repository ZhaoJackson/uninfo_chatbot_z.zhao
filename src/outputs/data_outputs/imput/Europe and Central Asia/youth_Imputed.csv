In 2022, the GoU has introduced substantial measures to simplify access to disability determination procedure, and disability allowances. UNICEF jointly with UNFPA, UNDP, OHCHR, the GoU and OPDs launched the UN Joint Programme funded by the UNPRPD. UNICEF supported 60 Organizations of People with Disabilities (OPDs) to enhance their capacities on implementing the CRPD.  UN Joint SitAn identified lack of OPD participation in government policy making; weak organizational capacity of OPDs, lack of OPDs led by underrepresented groups, such as women with disabilities and no OPDs representing families of children with disabilities. As leading agency under UNJP, UNICEF supported the establishment of the Steering Committee led by the Chairperson of the state Inter-Agency Group on CRPD and Advisory Group of OPDs. For the first time grassroots OPDs and SIG were included in the policy making platforms. The Advisory Group of OPDs and members of Steering Committee include OPDs based on cross-disability approach and members of self-initiative parents‚Äô groups (SIG).  Uzbekistan‚Äôs UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) is UNCT‚Äôs vision for one UN approach for CRPD implementation. UNICEF initiated the process as part of the recent findings from the UN Joint Situational (SitAn) Analysis on rights of people with disabilities. 25 UNCT members endorsed UNDIS under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator. UNDIS prioritizes the key pre-conditions for CRPD implementation in Uzbekistan in order to promote human rights-based approach to disability inclusion. At the same time, UNJP funded by UNPRPD and implemented jointly with the GoU and OPDs, provides coordinated approach in transforming social service delivery for women and children with disabilities.  UNDP supported the GoU efforts to incorporate international standards and best practices of disability inclusion. Together with governmental and nongovernmental partners, including OPDs it is providing technical assistance to nurture national expertise in disability assessment, social services, disability inclusive programming and budgeting. UNDP has capacitated the national partners and organizations of persons with disabilities (OPD) to provide more effective contributions towards disability inclusive policies, systems and the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in Uzbekistan, including on disability costing and budgeting in compliance with CRPD and the data collection, analysis and use to identify gaps and improve the budget allocation and usage, as well as on designing and building social services delivery for persons with disabilities. OPDs were systematically engaged in the national development strategy design through their involvement in the national development coordination mechanism and accountability frameworks.   To complement the SoP/MSR efforts a needs assessment on the availability, quality, accessibility and relevance of community-based services for GBV victims who are women and girls with disabilities was conducted on the example of Tashkent, Fergana and Samarkand regions of Uzbekistan. The study showed that further improvement of the legal and regulatory framework is required to protect the rights of people with disabilities, especially women and girls, as a special group at greater risk of violence and discrimination. A study also revealed that women and girls with disabilities experience isolation from society, which is a serious barrier to socialization and awareness.Training module on provision of inclusive services to GBV survivors was developed by the working group established from the representatives of NGOs, healthcare service provider, psychologists as well as members of the project Advisory group/organizations of people with disabilities. The training module and materials are based on the international experience, developed SOPs on MSR to GBV, governmental legislative documents, Central-Asian experience on the work with disabilities and international standards and provisions. 64 service-providers including the members of OPDs from Samarkand and Tashkent region were capacitated during pilot trainings conducted in coordination with the Senate Committee on gender equality and women as well as other national partners for Samarkand and Tashkent regions.",140187.0,86438.13,72880.61,"UNICEF: UNICEF's coordination in implementing the UN Joint Programme funded by UNPRPD resulted in provision of age-appropriate services for children, youth and women with functional difficulties.

Notably, UNICEF strengthened the capacity of 50,000 patronage nurses on early identification and intervention and 500 teachers on Universal Design for Education. Two inclusive schools with accessible infrastructure were modelled, generating evidence to advocate for a more integrated approach for inclusive service provision. UNFPA:For the first time disability inclusion was integrated into SOPs on MSR based on the practical guide for service providers developed with the support of UNFPA and the Committee of Family and Women. To increase the availability of services to marginalized women and girls, and within the nationwide ‚Äòimplementation and scale-up of SoP on MSR to GBV‚Äô, 239 representatives of law enforcement, healthcare, social, and psychological services providers and OPDs were trained to better understand the needs and respond to GBV with a focus on women and girls with disabilities.

The commitment to promote youth employment and reduce labour market detachment reflects the policy priorities that have been pursued by North Macedonia since 2018, when the Youth Guarantee ‚Äì modelled on the European Union one - was piloted in the country and then rolled out nation-wide the following year. 20185 (10316 women) persons registered with the Youth Guarantee in 2022, out of which 7419 (3595 women) got employed within 4 months of registration. Rate of the successful exit from the YG (Percentage of participants who successfully completed the Youth Guarantee) in 2022 was 43%.ILO/ EU supported Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP)of North Macedonia for the period 2022-2026 builds on the lessons learnt since 2018 and the principles set forth in the Council Recommendation on A Bridge to Jobs ‚Äì Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee (October 2020). Compared to the previous YG implementation plans, in the period 2022-2026 more emphasis will be placed on: (i) reaching out to detached young people where they mostly live, (ii) improving the quality of offers provided to young people registering in the YG service delivery system; (iii) establishing wider and better partnerships with other governmental and non-governmental actors, and (iv) building a stronger service delivery system.The YG delivery mechanism is expected to improve through: (i) the revision of organizational structure, staffing levels and funding envelope of the Employment Service Agency at the central, regional and local level; (ii) the expansion of preparation services (to include the validation non-formal and informal learning and outsourced employability courses) and subsidized offers of employment, continued education and training and traineeship; (iii) the strengthening of the Education Management of Information System (EMIS) and the increase of offer of adult education courses; (iv) the expansion of outreach activities and the progressive shift of tasks to municipal Youth Centres; and (v) data pooling mechanisms to allow the sharing of information across public institutions about young people (ESA, education, social security, tax authority, youth organizations, etc.).UNESCO: During 2022 UNESCO, as lead partner, together with the British Council and the Italian agency for Development Cooperation, launched the implementation of the EU-funded project Culture and Creativity for the Western Balkans, which includes North Macedonia among its beneficiaries. The project aims at promoting inclusive, fair and sustainable socio-economic development in WBs IPA Beneficiaries, and to improve reconciliation and good neighbourly relations in the region. Main thematic areas of intervention will be cultural heritage, intercultural dialogue, and creativity. The project will offer a systemic, effective and viable approach to enable progress across governance, policy and operational frameworks, by combining advice for policy improvement with data for informed decision-making, capacity-building, support to public-private partnerships, networking and funding opportunities for cultural and creative actors.ÔªøOne of the core activities during the Regional Project‚Äôs inception phase was the launch of a comprehensive desk research aimed at mapping cultural and creative sectors in the Western Balkans IPA Beneficiaries, covering existing data and statistics, national and international legal frameworks as well as key strategic documents, cultural governance structures and relevant competences, main cultural heritage sites and elements, along with prominent cultural projects, events and activities. Collected information is being organised and presented in ‚ÄúBeneficiary files‚Äú.The members of the Advisory Committee were officially appointed and the Committee‚Äôs Terms of Reference approved, together with the updated Project‚Äôs Workplan, Logical Framework, Visual Identity, and Inception Report. UNDP:During 2022, through different UN initiatives and support services, 5,351 unemployed where activated in the labour market out of which 3,717 (69.5%) where young unemployed with 2.400 NEET. 339 young people received various trainings in future skills in key industries or got required skills as per employer‚Äôs needs. UN supported the Employment Service Agency in implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Through two youth umbrella NGOs (engaged over 60 young field workers) to support ESA‚Äôs Employment Centers in identifying and registering young NEET. With the support, over 5,000 young unemployed and over 1.140 private companies were informed about Youth Guarantee scheme in ESA. Out of 5,000 informed young, 2,400 NEET were registered in ESA‚Äôs data base (1,553 women; 6 persons with disabilities; and 193 Roma). With UN support, in 2022 total 404 jobs were created for young unemployed (282 full-time and 122 part-time).

Among the innovations introduced is the application by the Employment Service Agency (ESA) of a youth-specific statistical profile model for client segmentation. In North Macedonia, institutions and organizations involved in the implementation of the youth guarantee have relied significantly on the ILO's facilitation of peer-learning and triangular cooperation with other public employment services from the region and from the EU.UNESCO: See sub-output 1.1.4.1.",511498.0,363681.48,252466.12,"UNDP:In 2024, the UN implemented targeted interventions to support youth employment, skills development, and labour market activation, with a particular focus on NEET youth. Through the Youth Guarantee initiative, 2,203 NEET youth benefitted from activation services, with 59% (1,299) being women. Dedicated youth coordinators played a key role in engaging young people, facilitating their transition into employment, education, or training.In parallel, tailored skills development programmes strengthened youth employability, equipping them with the necessary competencies to navigate the evolving labour market. A total of 2,300 unemployed individuals, including a significant number of young people, participated in business skills development and entrepreneurship training, leading to successful business creation and economic independence for many participants. Additionally, 385 individuals received specialized training to enhance their competitiveness in the job market.Employment outcomes for youth were further reinforced through active labour market measures (ALMMs), which contributed to the creation of 285 jobs for young people under 29 (159 full-time, 126 part-time). The integration of youth into the workforce was supported by youth (field) coordinators, who facilitated the activation of 505 NEET Roma youth, contributing to inclusive labour market participation.By leveraging targeted activation services, skills development programs, and inclusive employment measures, the UN continued to drive youth labour market participation, ensuring that young people, particularly those from vulnerable backgrounds, have access to meaningful economic opportunities.ILO:Phase II and Phase III of the EU-ILO Youth Guarantee Technical Assistance Facility continued to facilitate the labour market integration of unemployed and disengaged young women and men in N. Macedonia, in a systemic manner, through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. The ILO supported the enhancement of the framework conditions and institutional capacities requisite for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, through tailor-made technical guidance, recommendations, and capacity support. In this light, in 2024, the ILO focused on systematic support to the Employment Service Agency to enhance its functional organization; initiate a reform of the guiding legislation, which will enable modernization and digitalization of its services; reduce the deadweight through enhanced profiling of the unemployed persons and focusing the human and financial resources on the persons at greater risk of becoming long-term unemployed; improve the classification of employment services and ALMPs in line with the EU standards; adapt the ALMPs in the following years based on the cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the ILO facilitated 4 peer-learning events and exchanges of good practices among institutions involved in the design and implementation of the YG from the Western Balkans and EU Member States. It also facilitated the functioning of the regional Network of YG Coordinators, through organization of networking activities, aimed at strengthening institutional capacity via exchange of knowledge, information, and good practices.

Innovative schemes such as boot-camps, SDG hackathons that UNDP utilizes frequently to bring SuTP and Host community (HC) youth together can contribute to changing perceptions of young people at an early age when prejudices are easier to destroy. In this vein, in 2021 alone, UNDP brought together 1490 members of SuTP and HC youth in activities as diverse as ICT trainings, Hackathons, Mentorship, Social Cohesion and volunteering of which 645 are Syrians and 897 are women (both Turkish and Syrian) (EV ).
Additionally, in order to improve public sector capacities to promote social cohesion, UNDP trained 98 Youth Center Staff and Youth Volunteers of Ministry of Youth and Sports. The staff and volunteers organized Social Cohesion Festivals in Ankara, Bursa, Kocaeli, ƒ∞stanbul and ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. 62% of the trained youth and youth center staff was women. Hardware improvements were made for computer classrooms in 30 Youth Centers in nine provinces (Ankara, Kayseri, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, Hatay, Adana, Mersin, Kocaeli, Bursa and ƒ∞stanbul) so that the Ministry is better able to reach Syrian and Turkish youth to improve their ICT skills. The project procured and delivered equipment worth a total of US $680.000 to establish state-of-the-art computer classrooms in 30 Youth Centers. A technology Hackathon was organized with the participation of  72 SuTPs and HCs in 5 provinces to give a chance to create tech-based solutions to social cohesion problems. Four solutions that were prized included an online platform for increasing access of Syrian and Turkish Youth to employment, a mobile application that will make it easier for Turkish and Syrian youth living in close neighbourhoods to get to know each other and organize sports events, a software that displays trainings and cartoons with VR technology to children and an online application where Syrian and Turkish youth can play games together and match with each other in e-sports activities.""

UNAIDS inputs were included into Declaration of the Conference. 
ÔÄ≠	In October - December 2021 UNAIDS organized workshop for 10 young people living with HIV on public speaking skills development. The main purpose was to train young people on public speech to draw attention to the problems of social inequality, stigma and discrimination against young representatives of key groups and PLHIV. As a result, participants of the training prepared and did their presentation on internal meeting. Final speeches will be presented on 26 February 2022.

",100000.0,72898.79,69253.85,"Results and achievements:During July-August 2023, UNAIDS and UNICEF organized three training sessions for 76 adolescents and their parents from 9 regions in Uzbekistan. During the training participants were equipped with necessary knowledge on essential life skills for managing HIV, emphasizing the importance of HIV treatment, and fostering positive relationships with peers, parents, and healthcare professionals. The trainings were facilitated by four HIV+ young trainers, who are peer educators and UNAIDS volunteers. Two of them recently disclosed their HIV status, enabling them to share valuable information during the training and serve as role models for the participants. (Fergana 14,166 USD, Tashkent 22,053 USD)   On 26 October 2023, the Government of Uzbekistan initiated an international forum dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the topic: ""Youth rights: opportunities and protection mechanisms"". Gareth Jones, a UNAIDS consultant, highlighted diverse youth needs, UNAIDS' role in youth leadership, and challenges in HIV prevention. He praised Uzbekistan's Youth Parliament, emphasizing an enabling legal environment. The international consultant stressed the impact of punitive laws on key populations and shared insights from drafting the Agenda for Action for Adolescents. Gareth Jones urged leveraging the agenda for advocacy and making commitments to improve adolescent well-being.  Partnership: UNAIDS collaborated with UNICEF and NHRC to advocate for adolescent well-being and equip adolescents living with HIV and their parents with knowledge on essential life skills for managing HIV.  Lessons learnt:  The disclosure of HIV status by two young trainers serves as a powerful method for reducing stigma. By openly sharing their experiences, they become role models, challenging stereotypes, and contributing to a more supportive environment for individuals living with HIV.   Education, capacity building and awareness raising have become a powerful tool in empowering individuals to take control of their health and well-being. ",100000.0,95000.0,82795.9,"In August, UNAIDS supported in launching the #UzYouthMentor Project, a transformative mentoring initiative for young UNAIDS volunteers in Uzbekistan, in collaboration with Chevening alumni. Over the six-month mentoring journey, mentors and mentees will meet to focus on empowering transformation of young people living with HIV. As described by one of the mentors, mentoring is a powerful educational approach that challenges, inspires, and empowers both mentees and mentors to create meaningful personal and professional growth.  In November, UNAIDS, in collaboration with the Republican AIDS Center, conducted an information session for World AIDS Day at the private Sehriyo school for students in grades 8-11. Around 140 students attended, gaining accurate insights into HIV transmission, debunking myths, and learning about the stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV. In December, to amplify the voices of young people living with HIV, UNAIDS organized a meeting between members of YPLHIV and the UN Resident Coordinator. Several YPLHIV members shared their personal experiences, highlighting challenges such as discrimination in healthcare settings, barriers to education, and mental health issues.  In December, UNAIDS led an information session on HIV for students at Westminster International University in Tashkent to provide students with essential knowledge about HIV, fostering awareness and understanding among the university community. About 30 students and staff members of the university were engaged in the event. Three young people living with HIV shared their experiences of life with HIV and challenges they face because of the misinformation. UNAIDS implemented a photo project featuring young people living with HIV, promoting creativity and self-expression. A photo story of Azima, a young woman living with HIV, was published on the UNAIDS global website: Azima‚Äôs Story. In September, UNAIDS organized a specialized photography walk, led by a professional photographer, aimed at enhancing the photography skills of young people living with HIV. The event provided participants with practical, hands-on experience in photography techniques, fostering creativity, self-expression, and confidence. Throughout the walk, participants learned about the technical aspects of photography, such as composition, lighting, and camera settings, while also exploring storytelling through images.

Being a small-scale intervention, it helped create buy-in at the central and community levels for the gender equality concept among young men and boys, in particular.

The survey results, officially presented in early 2023 through open discussions with government representatives, academia, and youth NGOs, have been instrumental in shaping program activities for youth by various stakeholders, including UN agencies, the Ministry of Youth and Sports of Ukraine, youth NGOs, and youth centers, all guided by an evidence-based approach.In 2023, considering the context of ongoing war, limited access to the statistical data and displacement of youth, 5 partner municipalities (Kremenchuk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia and Lutsk) were able to join the new cycle of Youth Well-Being Index survey and finalized the conduction of the monitoring of the state of well-being of young people in their communities. In total, 2317 respondents aged 14-35 participated in the YWBI survey during 2023. Local authorities, NGOs and policymakers can use the data received in order to make informed decisions and develop targeted youth policies and programs in their communities. Also, thanks to the expanded functionality of the YWBI platform, Chernivtsi urban territorial community conducted additional online survey (565 respondents aged 14-35 y.o.) in order to determine the priorities areas, challenges and needs of local youth in the context of ongoing war and humanitarian response. The results were used for planning the activities of the youth center of Chernivtsi ""Youth Residence"", aimed at addressing the needs of young people and promote the realization of their potential in the existing context.",55000.0,47186.05,37935.57,"Youth Well-Being Index (YWBI) 2024The Youth Well-Being Index (YWBI) project aimed to measure youth well-being at the municipal level and support evidence-based policymaking. Given the ongoing war, access to statistical data was severely limited, and youth displacement further complicated the process. As a result, only three partner municipalities‚ÄîDnipro, Kremenchuk, and Lviv‚Äîwere able to participate in the latest YWBI survey cycle.In Dnipro, the survey was conducted between February and March 2024. Preliminary findings indicate:The highest indicator: Information and communication technologies (0.84, where 1 is the highest possible).The lowest indicator: Safety and security (0.42), highlighting a significant challenge for the municipality.These results emphasize the need for targeted interventions to enhance safety and security for young people in Dnipro. However, given the ongoing war, improving security conditions remains a complex issue requiring multi-sectoral coordination.In Lviv, the survey faced technical challenges on the platform and with partner businesses, preventing its successful implementation. As a result, no preliminary insights are available for Lviv at this stage.Youth Municipal Fund ‚Äì LvivIn 2024, UNFPA supported the establishment of the Youth Municipal Fund as part of Lviv‚Äôs European Youth Capital initiatives. The Fund aims to strengthen municipal youth policy by mobilizing resources for youth-led initiatives and fostering sustainable engagement with key stakeholders, including:The Ministry of Youth and Sports of Ukraine,The All-Ukrainian Youth Fund,The Lviv City Council.The Fund‚Äôs membership includes five youth organizations working together to expand opportunities for young people in Lviv:Plast Lviv,Molodvizh.Center,Society Initiatives Institute,Lviv Open Lab,Foundation for Regional Initiatives (–§–†–Ü).Key Achievements in 2024:Governance and Institutional FrameworkThe Fund successfully developed its charter and prepared the registration documents for the establishment of the Youth Public Union ""Youth Fund Lviv"".Outreach and VisibilityA brand book and website were created.A communication campaign was launched, reaching over 10,000 people.Partnerships and Resource Mobilization27 local businesses signed partnership agreements, ensuring sustainable financial support for youth programs.The Fund operates on a model where businesses allocate 10-50% of sales from jointly developed products to finance youth initiatives.Planned Interventions and Focus Areas:The Fund is designed to channel its resources into three key areas:Professional fulfillment of young people,Addressing the consequences of war,Promoting a culture of mental health care.The Fund aims to develop its interventions through a grant-based program, enabling young people to design and implement projects aligned with these priority areas. However, in 2024, no grant programs were launched, as the focus was on establishing the Fund‚Äôs legal and institutional framework.Importantly, the Fund integrates demographic resilience into its long-term strategy, ensuring that youth programming responds to war-driven demographic shifts. Future initiatives will target displaced youth, community cohesion, and sustainable youth-led development in conflict-affected areas.",101666.66666666667,64878.25,58954.82,-,,,,-,,,,-

UNICEF-UNDP joint work to support the Ministry of Economy and Finance proves that strategic planning capacities with sound results frameworks at various levels of public administration (national/strategic, regional, sectoral, institutional) are critical prerequisites for implementation of PBB in Uzbekistan.   UNICEF‚Äôs contribution in joint work under Global Flagship Finance Initiative was significant. At the initial stage UNICEF CO was swift to pitch to RO that national partners have been requesting continued support following successful accomplishment of UN Joint Programme to establish Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF). This was well supported by UNICEF ECARO through initiating discussions with and obtaining support of UNDP RO. Later, at the implementation stage UNICEF lead both programme implementation and administration of received funds.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the work was built on the extensive experience and comparative advantage of both UNICEF and UNDP: while UNICEF leveraged its strong expertise in development of key performance/programme outcome/output indicators for social sectors, as well as PF4C Global Framework to link them with the budgets, UNDP brought its extensive experience towards supporting the Government‚Äôs PFM reform agenda pertaining to SDG Financing (SDG budget tagging, SDG bonds, Tax for SDGs initiative etc.). UNICEF-UNDP joint work under Global Flagship Finance Initiative demonstrated One UN approach in action. It has complemented the work that both agencies have been conducting to support the government of Uzbekistan in establishing the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) and provided additional inputs for finalizing the SDG Financing Strategy. It also opened new opportunities for continued and closer partnership around ensuring coherence and coordination of conceptually interconnected reforms in strategic planning, budget management at all levels of public administration.

As a result of the progressive advocacy, the two bodies for functional assessments based on the ICF, covering the Skopje region, and the National expert body for functional assessment that were created with UNICEF support were taken over by the state healthcare system. Namely, the Public Health Center (PHC) Skopje, opened a new Service for functional assessment of children and youth up to 26 years of age, and from January 2021 it started with provision of regular assessments of children and youth from the Skopje region. In the period May-October 2021, with support from UNICEF, training and mentoring on ICF-based functional assessments was conducted in Pelagonija, Polog and South-West regions, involving almost fifty professionals. With UNICEF advocacy the PHC Skopje has engaged twelve of the persons whose capacity has been developed to staff three new regional functional assessment bodies in Strumica, Bitola and Gostivar. UNICEF also supported fifteen workshops to present the new model for functional assessment to service providers ‚Äì including Centers for Social Work (CSW), schools and kindergartens ‚Äì as well as parents in the three targeted regions.

UNICEF coordinated with line ministries and other relevant institutions the drafting of amendments to the Social Protection Law, Child Protection Law, Health Insurance Law, Healthcare Law and Primary Education Law in order to consolidate the provision of functional assessments for children and youth in line with the ICF. The amendments were approved by the Government and were put on the agenda of Parliament in December 2021. UNICEF also supported the revision of the draft Rulebook on ICF-based disability assessments, so that it is aligned with the three line-ministries ‚Äì Health, Education and Science, and Labour and Social Policy ‚Äì as well as other relevant institutions. 

While UNICEF has supported the establishment of functional assessment bodies which cover four of the eight regions of North Macedonia, children and youth outside the covered regions could not complete such an assessment and were thus not eligible to obtain access to educational and personal assistants. This resulted in difficulties in exercising their right to education, as well as problems in carrying out their everyday activities.

However, in rural areas, agriculture remains the primary source of income, albeit with significantly lower wages compared to urban regions and industrial sectors. As a result, the rural population has been steadily shrinking over the past decades, dropping from 23 percent of the total population in 2013 to just 19 percent in 2023 .
Moreover, lower wages, limited job opportunities and inadequate living conditions also make living in the rural areas especially unpopular to the younger generations. While regarding children, the age distribution of the urban and rural populations has only two percentage points of difference (18.4 percent in urban and 16.4 percent in rural areas), the share of elderly is significantly higher in rural areas (30 percent) than in urban areas (21.1percent) . Thus, the Government of Belarus has made it a priority to focus more on rural youth to learn more about their needs and the challenges they face. By generating new knowledge and insights into the situation of rural youth, decision-makers in Belarus will be able to produce more efficient, evidence-based youth policies. After recognizing the need to bridge this knowledge gap, the Government has requested support from the FAO REU Office to collaborate on gathering comprehensive data on the specific needs of rural young women and men - especially young farmers - who are crucial for maintaining rural communities. 
The project will result in an analysis report on the situation and needs of rural youth. This study will provide a detailed understanding of the socioeconomic and environmental landscape of rural youth in Belarus, taking into account the gender differences, enabling the design of tailored and effective strategies, policies and interventions. Insights from this research will lead to the formulation of policy recommendations, drawing also on international good practices as well as discussions with crucial local stakeholders. The project will aim at building on the results achieved under three related projects, namely TCP/BYE/3703/C2 project titled Support for rural development policy assessment and community development feasibility study, specifically considering the main outcomes of the feasibility study as well as the policy recommendations; TCP/BYE/3802 titled Promoting women's entrepreneurship in rural areas, specifically on the findings and recommendations of the ‚Äú National gender profile of agriculture and rural livelihoods‚Äù conducted under this project, and of TCP/BYE/3803/C3 titled Promotion of Local Markets, specifically on the findings and recommendations of the technical report on ‚ÄòThe Landscape of Digital Agrifood Markets in Belarus: state of the art, challenges and opportunities‚Äù.  
Furthermore, a draft concept note will be prepared for a project for upscaling the youth support in the country, aiming at improving the situation of rural youth through creating sustainable employment opportunities for young women and men and contribute to rural development.

Joint work allowed to align the Concept with international guidelines and better define the strategic directions, mechanisms, and conditions for the formation of universal competencies of children and young people at different levels of education. The Concept embraced the general framework of the universal 21st century competencies developed within Belarus educational system, with a particular focus on social-emotional skills (SES).

The ME tool was co-created with adolescents from technical vocational colleges who provided recommendations and feedback. The tool will be piloted in 2024.To ensure the quality and sustainability of the SES integration in the education process the SES normative framework was supplemented by development of an in-service training programme for general secondary and technical vocational education teachers and methodological recommendations for different groups (e.g. teachers, administrations, parents) on how to integrate SES in the education process in schools and colleges.The in-service training programme for pedagogues was complemented with a curriculum for an elective courses on advancement of social-emotional skills among 3-4th and 6th-7th grade students and trainer guide developed by the NIE.

Since the support programme was launched in 2019, 19 LPAs out of 35 received comprehensive support from UNFPA, which is 54,28%. The programme will continue in 2024 and further reach out to at least 65% of LPAs. To support evidence-based planning in the youth sector, UNFPA conducted an annual analysis of rayon youth sector budgets showing the trend per each rayon (district compared to previous years and other districts). The network of Youth Centers was further supported in strengthening professional skills, programs and mobilizing young people at the local level. https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/nicoleta-reaboi-today-girls-our-country-have-opportunity-learn-express-their-opinions-and-lead In 2023, the Youth Centers Network expanded and counted 60 centers throughout the country. Only in the first semester of 2023, the Youth Centers reached over 28,000 young people (for the second-semester data is not yet available), including young refugees, young people from rural areas, young people with disabilities, etc. To align the youth work in Moldova to European standards UNFPA supports the National Youth Agency in developing a continuous training programme for youth workers, the activity will be completed in 2024. The annual Youth Workers Forum was co-supported by UNFPA. More than 200 young people and representatives of youth organizations advocated for youth role as agents of change during International Youth Day with UNFPA support https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/%E2%80%9Etrain-youth%E2%80%9D-gathered-young-people-all-over-country-ungheni-celebrate-international-youth-day 17 civic initiatives of young people from the country were supported methodologically and financially in 2023. More than 380 young people teamed up together with Youth Centers, teachers, and civil servants to transform for the better the localities in which they live. Gender stereotypes and discrimination, environmental crisis, lack of recreational spaces for youth, vocational orientation - these are just a few of the issues identified by young people across the country in the 'YouCreate' program. https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/young-people-solve-problems-local-level-17-initiatives-implemented-youth-their-communities",383500.0,335931.82,232351.16,"UNFPA in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Research, the National Youth Agency, with funds from Swiss Development Cooperation and other key partners, achieved the following key results during 2024 to advance youth civic engagement and participation:In 2024, 8 districts from the country benefited from coaching and mentorship in development of result-oriented local youth action plans, local youth strategies, local youth programs. The support program for LPAs provided a detailed analysis of the situation of young people in the targeted districts and training for authorities, local youth organizations and young people active in the community in strategic planning of youth activities and participatory budgeting. It also provided individualized assistance for the development of a results-oriented action plan, adapted to local needs and tailored to the available resources for the next calendar year.  Since the Support Programe for LPAs was launched in 2019, 22 LPAs out of 35 received comprehensive support from UNFPA, which is more than 63% of LPAs.  To support evidence-based planning in the youth sector, UNFPA conducted an annual analysis of rayon youth sector budgets showing the trend per each rayon (district compared to previous years and other districts). The Report for 2024 is available here. UNFPA supported the Youth Centers Network in strengthening youth workers professional skills, programs and mobilizing young people at the local level. Thus, in 2024, the Youth Centers Network expanded and counted 67 centers throughout the country. Only in the first semester of 2024, the Youth Centers reached over 43754 young people (for the second-semester data is not yet available), including young refugees, young people from rural areas, young people with disabilities, etc.In order to align the youth work system from Moldova to European standards, UNFPA Moldova continuously supports the National Youth Agency in implementing the road map on youth work curriculum development. Thus, during 2024 were developed and approved the National Qualifications Framework for youth workers and the National Occupational Framework. The ongoing support for road map implementation is planned also for 2025.The annual Youth Workers Forum (2024 edition) was co-supported by UNFPA. More than 2600 young people with fewer opportunities, from rural remote areas, attended non formal educational and recreational activities, including outdoor activities within the Mobile Youth Center Program, supported by UNFPA.  UNFPA supports youth participation and civic engagement, with voting being one of the most impactful ways for young people to make their voices heard and contribute to the country's development. In 2024, UNFPA supported implementation of the youth mobilization campaign ""Drop Everything and Go Vote!‚Äù, organized by the Youth Centers Network with the National Youth Agency's guidance. This campaign was carried out with support from the United Nations Population Fund, Soros Foundation Moldova, and the Government of Switzerland. Thus, in recent national elections in the Republic of Moldova, youth voter turnout has increased. During the second round of the presidential elections on November 3, 2024, more than half of young people aged 18‚Äì25 (51.78%) and 26‚Äì35 (52.04%) cast their votes, maintaining the record turnout from the 2020 elections. The growing number of young voters results from sustained mobilization efforts and support through various opportunities and programs that encourage civic activism among youth. Young people are becoming more aware of their vote's power and ability to influence decision-making processes and actively participate in them.The potential to participate in change, think critically and use technology in a safe mode to the personal advantage were the key highlights of the series of public events organized in the frame of the International Youth Day, conducted with UNFPA support. The events were attended of more than 500 young people, representatives of youth organizations, LPAs and local youth led organizations. https://moldova.unfpa.org/ro/events/zit-2024-tinerii-pentru-spa%C8%9Bii-digitale-sigure-%C8%99i-incluzive ",319000.0,260611.24,217286.11,-,294000.0,294000.0,,-,,,,-

The First Youth TV Channel was established and functions as a unique communication platform for all youth workers throughout Ukraine, and already has 2,400 subscribers and 35K viewers on Facebook. 
Over 100 (60 duty bearers, 40 right holders) youth activists and public servants responsible for youth policy on subnational levels were engaged into online public discussion on the draft State Target Social Programme ‚ÄòYouth of Ukraine 2021-2025', organized by the UNDP on the request of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Some 283 participants (81 men, 202 women) gained experience in and basic knowledge of volunteering by implementing 11 local initiatives and 17 volunteer events. Additionally, 38 partner organizations joined volunteer activities. The participants of local events received the opportunity to get acquainted with the activities of local organizations and join them as volunteers that boosted the organizational capacity of local NGOs, which often have low visibility among local residents. According to the Ukrainian Volunteer Service estimations, around 30-35% of participants still keep in touch with the organizations they met at the Volunteer School and participate in further activities. 
Seven subnational youth civic initiatives were implemented in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kirovograd, Chernivtsi and Kherson oblasts, through which 831 young people (499 women, 332 men) were engaged in design and implementation of 21 civic education activities and 5 advocacy campaigns. The advocacy campaigns have resulted in adoption of 5 subnational youth policy documents which provide for establishing local youth councils, developing regulations on youth advisers in local administration, establishing competition of youth initiatives in the local administration, introducing volunteer management classes for university students and green waste management programmes at territorial community. 
According to the results of independent assessment of 44 youth-led initiatives supported by UNDP in 2017-2021, the initiatives contributed to the creation of community of people involved in the public and civic sectors who know how to engage young people.  Young people are now more inclined to believe that their ideas may come true. More than half of respondents, inspired by the experience, plan to continue their civic activity in follow-up initiatives. This implies an active search for new ideas and their implementation at the local level, or engagement as participants and volunteers (for more than a third of respondents). Still, one in ten participants engaged in youth civic initiatives is not motivated to participate in similar activities further.

Sanitary pad dispensers are installed in girls' restrooms, ensuring students in all 164 schools no longer need to leave class or seek pads from classmates or the school nurse.Within three months of installing the dispensers, the percentage of girls in the pilot schools who missed at least one class during their menstrual period dropped over fourfold, from 55.2% to 12.5%.Additionally, 56% of the girls surveyed said they feel safe at school. Nearly 39% of them also reported that boys no longer make jokes about menstruation and have become more respectful.School absenteeism during menstruation is a reality in our country, as confirmed by teachers and social workers. Due to low family incomes, many girls are forced to skip classes or use alternative products such as cotton, gauze, tissues, socks, bedsheets, or even sleeves from their younger siblings' clothing.In an online survey involving 558 female students, many respondents reported experiencing irregular and heavy menstrual cycles, hormonal imbalances, and, in the absence of enough sanitary pads, having to leave school early in the day. Moreover, menstruation now often begins much earlier (at 8‚Äì9 years old), making access to pads a necessity rather than a luxury.In the new school year, alongside equipping schools with dispensers and sanitary pads, nearly 700 teaching and non-teaching staff participated in online training sessions. These sessions focused on puberty development, menstrual health and hygiene, and effective communication about sensitive and ""taboo"" topics. Following the training, teachers, school psychologists, and medical staff educated students about the natural changes in their bodies and how to navigate certain situations.In addition, the menstrual hygiene program was piloted in 41 Youth-Friendly Health Centers, and 67 Youth Centers across the country.A partnership with a pharmaceutical company resulted in co-financing with UNFPA for key resources, including menstrual pads, furniture for two medical offices, and student educational activities.",10000.0,7170.17,5731.19,-,,,,-,,,,-

Within the framework of the project, the Skills Agency elaborated (and will be enhanced in the upcoming months) the Capacity Building Programme encompassing general modules, VET authorization standard specific modules and respective guidelines to help public schools prepare for the authorization processes granting them a right to implement short term training-retraining VET programmes. These will ensure inclusion of NEET youth and other vulnerable groups into the learning process On the national level, the project ensures accessibility of VET system by NEETs and other vulnerable groups conducted by the Skills Agency. The following key results were achieved in partnership with the Skills Agency: ¬∑      the Skills Agency developed career management service, the same as orientation service for persons with disabilities. Based on the regulatory framework of the inclusive education, the orientation service provides opportunities to persons with disabilities to use the service throughout the year and prepare for the desired professions. ¬∑      the Skills Agency began to develop sectoral network of VET teachers in the ares of personal services and health care. The sectoral network is percieved as one of the key mechanisms for supporting teachers in VET, through enhancing development of VET teachers, professional advancement, sharing of sectoral news and cooperation between VET teachers. ¬∑      To strengthen VET institutions through introducing entreperenurial VET college model, the Skills Agency trained relevant personnel and identified the organizational structure. ¬∑      The concepts for introducing digital and blended learning in the helath and wellness sectors of Georgia, as well as distance and home-based work opportunities are elaborated including elaborating the new qualifications, occupational and educational standards as per requirement of new regulatory framework, which in addition to ‚Äûcompetency mapping‚Äú and validation process implies increased private sector engagement. ¬∑      the Skills Agency elaborated the Capacity Building Programme encompassing general modules, VET authorization standard specific modules and respective guidelines to help public schools prepare for the authorization processes granting them a right to implement short term training-retraining VET programmes.In total 1516 VET students and schoolchildren, 16 college staff members, 34 HUB college staff members, 41 HUB college partners, 92 college and school staff members and partners from local governments benefitted from availability of needs-based institutional development plans put in practice for provision of diversified VET services.   ",500000.0,452639.38,377373.11,"  UNDP‚Äôs achievements in this direction include the following:  &gt;Establishing strong foundations for institutional development and introducing vocational training into general education. The project accomplished this by elaborating comprehensive guidelines and developing relevant capacity-development programmes for public schools, thus enabling them to obtain authorization for vocational programme implementation.  &gt;Introducing extracurricular activities through clubs and institutionalizing relevant student services led by Sunny House (Project Partner). These achievements contributed to enriching educational outcomes and developing competencies that are in high demand in the labour market (something that has proven difficult to achieve exclusively through formal education). The project also transformed student life, making it more engaging, accessible, motivating and productive. UNDP (CBLLL project) supported the development of new programmes and educational opportunities in the target sectors by establishing platforms, networks and capacity-building opportunities. (CBLLL supports the organizational development of sectoral skills organizations by creating new sectoral networks comprised of college-level academic and private-sector representatives).  UNDP CBLLL project has transformed two partner VET colleges into entrepreneurial organizations, thus creating unique spaces for learning and development in the region. The project focused on NEET (not engaged in employment, education or training) youth and empowered VET providers by introducing ‚Äòcatch-up‚Äô courses as a second-chance opportunity. Two such catch-up courses on digital and financial literacy have been developed and are slated to be piloted in partner schools. Other planned activities in this area include capacity-building for school administrators and teachers.  The project elaborated and strengthened services for supporting the key competency development of youth, NEETs and persons with disabilities, thus making vocational education accessible, relevant and inclusive for lifelong learning. In vocational education, accessibility, inclusiveness and relevancy of services are immensely important on multiple individual and societal levels. Although vocational education is focused on educating for the labour market, the social impacts of creating fair and equal opportunities by engaging vulnerable populations in productive activities for individual and the common good should not be overlooked.  To that end, CBLLL activities create new models and modalities to ensure that vocational education is relevant to the needs of both human and labour market development and that it offers innovative services, including digital and blended learning. The project developed a concept note on introducing digital and blended learning in Georgia to be used as a guiding document for digitizing resources and processes in VET systems.  Educational resources, modules and videos created in entrepreneurial learning enhance entrepreneurship competencies in formal and informal education programmes that are available in VET institutions. The elaboration of career education and orientation services for persons with disabilities was introduced in partnership with the Skills Agency. These services, available through vocational education institutions, are essential instruments for advancing opportunities and skills for better employment.  Following UNDP‚Äôs long-standing experience and approach, the project‚Äôs elaborated and piloted models are institutionalized for replication and nationwide scale-up in other sectors.

The report indicates that youth are eager to participate in society, but that opportunities and access to information are limited. The existing legal framework promotes youth participation, but there is a lack of established mechanisms and youth-led platforms.Key areas of concern include health and social protection, education and employment, gender equality, and marginalized youth.

The report emphasizes the need for increased investment in mental health support, recreational opportunities, social protection, and climate resilience for young people.The education system, while inclusive, requires improvements in teacher training and modernization of vocational education. The transition to work life remains challenging, with high rates of youth unemployment and a need for better career guidance and employment support services.

The Network of Peer Educators teamed up with Pupils Council in VET and jointly organized an informational Campaign on preventing HIV/AIDS starting with December 1st.

This initiative will follow UNFPA‚Äôs International Technical and Programmatic Guidance on Out-of-School CSE and will focus on reaching adolescents and young people in rural areas, those with disabilities, and youth from the left bank of the Nistru River.
In 2024, the initiative aims to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment where all young people, regardless of their background, have access to comprehensive sexuality education and essential resources for a healthy and informed future. To achieve this, several institutions and organizations working with youth will be equipped with dedicated spaces for non-formal sexuality education activities.
Additionally, civil society organizations, particularly those in underserved regions, will receive support to enhance their capacity in promoting young people‚Äôs sexual and reproductive health and rights. Specialists from various organizations will be trained to deliver accurate, age-appropriate education on these topics, ensuring that young people are well-informed and empowered.
Furthermore, parents and caregivers of adolescents with disabilities will be provided with the necessary knowledge and resources to support their children‚Äôs development and smooth transition into adulthood.
In 2025, UNFPA will continue strengthening civil society organizations and youth networks across Moldova, including those on the left bank of the Nistru River, to develop and implement programs on sexual and reproductive health and rights tailored to diverse youth groups. To support these efforts, UNFPA will create guidelines for delivering youth-friendly health services for vulnerable youth, aligned with international out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (OOS CSE) standards.
A digital training program will be introduced for facilitators working in CSE, ensuring they are well-equipped to provide accurate and effective education. Additionally, new educational and interactive materials, such as the Diary of an Adolescent Boy/Girl, will be developed to make information on sexual and reproductive health and rights more accessible and relevant to young people.
