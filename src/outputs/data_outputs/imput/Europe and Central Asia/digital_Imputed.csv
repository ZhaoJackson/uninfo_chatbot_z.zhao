Montenegro is unwavering in its commitment to execute this plan effectively and to further enhance its domestic legislation on gender equality, thus guaranteeing women's complete involvement in decision-making processes. Moreover, Montenegro is actively engaged in ongoing efforts to raise awareness and conduct educational campaigns aimed at ending violence against women, which includes the active participation of men and boys. At the inception of the project, a gender analysis of the situation in the country will be conducted. The project aims at encouraging women and youth to participate in the project activities, and to ensure that women and men, as well as persons with disabilities, equally benefit from capacity building and other activities wherever possible. The project will also benefit from the equal participation of women and men in both project management and as beneficiaries, partners and key stakeholders of the project.

In compliance with the UNIDO Gender Mainstreaming Guidelines, project personnel will take the basic ‚ÄúI Know Gender‚Äù online course in the UN Women e-Learning Campus (https://trainingcentre.unwomen.org) for learning and promoting relevant issues. Further, all advocacy materials and other communication activities will use gender-inclusive language and gender-balanced representation as well as not use images/descriptions that would reinforce gender stereotypes. The Gender digital divide is considered for project activities. Specific challenges for women to access and adopt frontier technologies will be addressed and raised whenever possible. It should be noted that statistics for university graduates show that women are better educated in Montenegro than men. However, employment statistics show much lower figures in active employment7. Against this background, the project will ensure that female participation is actively promoted, particularly when it comes to identifying pilot companies to use the technologies for digitalizing cultural heritage Providing innovative, cutting-edge technologies specifically to female entrepreneurs could have a positive reinforcement effect, so any criteria for selection will specifically consider companies with higher percentages of female employment, and encourage others to target women in their activities for cultural heritage. Further the project will collect sex-disaggregated data, whenever feasible, and advocate the inclusion of women-run/-owned enterprises for pilot activities when companies are involved.

The CoP is a crucial factor influencing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, farmers' incomes, the sustainability of farming systems, and overall food production potential. It provides a key analytical tool for evaluating and comparing competitiveness across different farming systems and agricultural enterprises. ",95938.0,61350.32,43553.06,-,,,,-,,,,-

Project Title: Digitalization of Customs Services in Moldova (PHASE 1 and 2)
In short: The project modernizes Moldova‚Äôs customs operations by introducing digital tools for e-commerce processing, electronic certificates of origin, and customs decision management. It improves efficiency, reduces paperwork, and enhances communication between customs and traders.
Start date: 30.06.2021 (beyond UNSDCF)

Review of expected accomplishments and activities:
These projects are governed by the Contribution Agreement signed between European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) with the purpose to:
‚Ä¢	Phase 1 
‚Ä¢	Support to the Customs Service in facilitating cross-border e-commerce through the digitisation of pre-arrival processing for postal and express consignments (E-Commerce Project)
‚Ä¢	Support to the Customs Service in implementing Electronic Certificates of preferential Origin (eCPO Project)
‚Ä¢	Phase 2 
‚Ä¢	Digitalising the Customs decision making and decision management processes by implementing the CSRM Customs Decisions Management System. The single repository of Customs decisions will be interfaced with the CSRM ASYCUDAWorld Customs Declaration Processing System to enable automatic verification checks i.e. check the existence and validity of individual customs decisions (Deliverable 1).
‚Ä¢	Simplifying the trading environment and enhance the transparency of customs clearance processes by implementing the CSRM Trader Dashboard (Deliverable 2).
‚Ä¢	Improving the overall efficiency and digitalisation of Customs operations, enabling a paperless environment (Deliverable 3).

Effects, impact and results: 
‚Ä¢	eCommerce  
‚Ä¢	Express shipments 
ÔÇß	Following the legislative changes effective 1st August 2024, there has been a significant rise in the volume of electronic Manifests and Airwaybills submitted by express couriers
ÔÇß	During the initial testing phase, only two participants were involved. However, the number of express operators utilizing the new system has steadily grown, increasing from 5 in August 2024 (when the legislation was implemented) to 12 by December 2024
ÔÇß	Although the number of express couriers using system-to-system information exchange increased from 5 to 12, the proportion of shipments eligible for maximum simplifications (Categories 1 & 2) remains unchanged at approximately 98%. This indicates that the vast majority of shipments can still be released immediately upon arrival, without requiring further formalities such as the submission of H6/H1 customs declarations
ÔÇß	The new system has had a more substantial impact on major express operators, given the high volume of transactions they process (e.g. operator with 534,065 transactions per month)
ÔÇß	There is still room for improvement. A review of the data is recommended to identify additional ways to optimize processes. For instance, some express couriers handle a higher volume of simplified declarations. This raises the question of whether a system-to-system exchange for H6-simplified declarations should be developed and integrated into the current version
‚Ä¢	Postal shipments 
ÔÇß	The volume of parcels processed through Posta Moldovei remains substantial
ÔÇß	A large majority of postal items arriving in Moldova are accompanied by information from the origin. In December 2024, 94.8% of postal items included electronic advance data (EAD), a figure comparable to the average of 95.57% observed across Europe (Western and Eastern Europe combined). This high percentage enables the reuse of existing information, eliminating the need for additional data capture.
ÔÇß	Despite this progress, Posta Moldovei continues to face challenges in transmitting the required information for imports (e.g. duplicates)
‚Ä¢	The eCommerce outputs from the EBRD funded project (post and express) have been officially communicated to the WTO Trade Facilitation Committee 
‚Ä¢	The eCommerce Postal solution implemented in Moldova has been presented during global WCO-UPU events in Brussels in November 2024. and at UNCTAD Global Supply Chain Forum, May 2024
‚Ä¢	Customs Decisions Management System (CDMS)
‚Ä¢	The Customs Decisions Management System (CDMS) was presented to and validated by DGTAXUD on 29 February 2024. As of end 2024, a total of 215 applications have been processed, resulting in 174 active authorizations
‚Ä¢	Trader Dashboard 
‚Ä¢	The Trader Portal and CDMS were developed on the same open-source platform as the NCTS-MD. Both solutions are seamlessly integrated within the same platform as NCTS and are fully interfaced with the NCTS, along with the CSRM ASYCUDAWorld system. Currently, there are 1,676 active users on the new integrated platform (Trader Dashboard ‚Äì CDMS ‚Äì NCTS)
‚Ä¢	Electronic Certificate of Origin
‚Ä¢	The electronic Certificate of Origin solution has been presented to the DG TAXUD together with a brief presentation of all deliverables under Phase I and II, receiving very good feedback
‚Ä¢	DG TAXUD indicated that the sub-component covering the EUR-1/EUR-MED certificates can be deployed in other contracting parties to the PEM convention taking into consideration the fact that o ASYCUDA user countries are party to the Convention (Western Balkans: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo; Mediterranean countries: Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria; Eastern Partnership countries: Moldova and Georgia)

Despite this upward trend in production, the average earnings of smallholder farmers experienced a decline of 0.2 percent in 2022 compared to 2020.
Smallholders in Belarus encounter several challenges, including restricted access to natural resources, inadequate financial and human resources, and lack of machinery and equipment. Additionally, low uptake of modern technologies, low input quality, and insufficient knowledge and skills hinder growth of smallholder farms. 
In 2022, Belarus was ranked 22nd globally for ""Access to Information and Communication Technologies"" in the Global Innovation Index. By early 2024, the internet penetration rate in Belarus reached 89.5 percent, with LTE (long-term evolution) mobile internet coverage extending to 93 percent of the country and approximately 35 percent of the population having access to broadband internet in 2023.
Recognizing the transformative potential of digital technologies in agri-food sector, the Belarus Government prioritized the digitalization of agriculture in the State Programme ‚ÄúAgrarian Enterprise‚Äù for 2021-2025 and the State Programme ‚ÄúDigital Development of the Republic of Belarus‚Äù for 2021-2025. Furthermore, the State Programme ‚ÄúEnhancing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (2021-2025)‚Äù includes initiatives to enhance the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises, including smallholder farms, to leverage digital technologies for optimizing processes and increasing competitiveness. Additionally, several Technology Parks that provide services in the field of agriculture have been established in Belarus to promote the adoption of digital technologies through educational seminars, fairs, and technology demonstrations. Despite these efforts, the reach of TechnoParks to include smallholder farmers in the digital transformation is quite limited and the adoption of digital technologies by smallholder farmers in Belarus remains low.
FAO‚Äôs study on agricultural innovation systems in the CIS of 2018 found that the main bottleneck in stimulating agricultural innovation in Belarus is the lack of a holistic and systematic provision of agricultural information and advisory services in the food system for small and medium-sized agricultural holdings. Additionally, a 2023 FAO nationwide survey of smallholder farmers in Belarus indicated that 14.3 percent of respondents identified the lack of knowledge and skills as the most significant constraint to farm growth. 
In response to these challenges and as per request of the Government of Republic of Belarus, this TCP project will assess and analyze the current capacities of TechnoParks, understand the specific needs of smallholder farmers, and develop strategic recommendations with the objective to enhance the capacity of TechnoParks to facilitate adoption of digital technologies among smallholder farmers.

The project will aim to assess digital literacy levels among adults, identifying skill gaps that affect employment, with the goal to improve employability by addressing these gaps and providing insights into necessary technological skills.

In alignment with national policy documents, such as ‚ÄòMoldova EuropeanƒÉ 2030‚Äô and the ‚ÄòEduca»õia 2030‚Äô program, there is a strong emphasis on developing an accessible, flexible, and relevant system for continuous adult education. This focus includes enhancing digital competencies and leveraging information technologies to improve digital literacy across various adult groups. In response to a request from the Ministry of Education and Research in 2021, the International Labour Organization (ILO) is supporting the promotion of digital literacy for adults (45-65) in rural areas, with a particular focus on low-skilled / low-educated populations, women and disadvantaged groups.

The ILO project proposes a comprehensive assessment of digital literacy among the above-mentioned segments of the adult population in Moldova. The assessment will focus on digital skills, evaluating current competencies and identifying technological skill gaps that impact employment and employability of low-skilled and disadvantaged adults. The primary objective is to gauge digital skills in rural areas, identify gaps, and provide insights into technological skills necessary for improving employability for unemployed and disadvantaged populations.

To effectively carry out this assessment and leverage the expertise required, the ILO signed a UN-to-UN agreement with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), (hereinafter ‚ÄòImplementing Partner‚Äô). This partnership will ensure access to ITU's specialized knowledge and resources in digital skills assessment, enhancing the quality and impact of the evaluation.

The ITU will be responsible for designing the methodology for the assessment, conducting the assessment, and drafting a report, including recommendations.

State authorities are committed to use these Guidelines to formulate national policies and strategies that align with contemporary global Internet safety trends. In parallel, industry organizations will have the capacity to leverage the Guidelines to establish safer and more secure services tailored for children. Simultaneously, parents and educators will gain valuable insights to assist them in recognizing potential threats and risks children might encounter online. This guidance will empower them to preempt and effectively address these challenges in a timely manner.2) In partnership with IT-Park Uzbekistan, the course materials ‚ÄòInformation Security in Digital Education Space‚Äô, developed jointly by the ITU Regional Office for CIS and the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education, were successfully adapted to the national context and translated into Uzbek. An online course on information security (available at cop-itpark.uz) is specifically designed to provide training for teachers and individuals who engage with children in their professional roles, and it is offered free of charge. Moreover, online course has built-in accessibility features, that allow users with disabilities to successfully complete it. It consists of several modules covering the following topics: information security issues, basic legislation in the field of information technology and information protection, the relationship between the use of digital devices and children's mental health, organizing children's information security behavior in the digital space, cyber hygiene and cyber security for students, computer viruses and analysis of software products aimed at ensuring children's information security in the digital educational space. Upon successful completion of the course, each participant receives a certificate that attests to their accomplished training and signifies their capability to apply the acquired knowledge in their everyday undertakings.3) 305 teachers (275 men and 30 women) from 14 regions of Uzbekistan, affiliated with IT Parks and IT-Academies, were trained on information security during a series of offline trainings. The trained instructors will apply their newfound knowledge over the next six months while teaching IT courses, thereby imparting the fundamentals of online child protection to their students on a consistent basis.4) ITU provided expert assistance to Uzbekistan on addressing challenges related to broadband Internet connectivity at schools, network resiliency and monitoring quality of service. The following national studies are carried out by ITU experts in this area: (a) study on the actual use and quality of Internet connectivity in schools; (b) study on the resilience of LAN infrastructure in schools. In 2023, a methodology for each study was developed and initial data was collected.5) In February and September 2023, 7 representatives of IT Park Uzbekistan took part in online training 'ITU tools for connecting schools to the Internet' (participants gained knowledge and practical skills about the most promising technologies for school connectivity, ITU tools to be used to estimate capital and operating costs in all sections of the telecommunications network (incl. school LAN), mapping and analysing broadband network infrastructure) and ITU regional event 'Broadband Week: connecting schools - expanding the opportunities of education of tomorrow!'  held in Kostanay, Kazakhstan (participants discussed policy and regulatory aspects of school connectivity and gained knowledge and practical skills on technological and economic aspects of broadband school connectivity).",15000.0,12272.25,11426.13,-,55000.0,44674.1,38107.26,-,,,,-,,,,-

UNDP served as the primary development partner to the MLSP in the transformative digitalization of social protection. A new integrated digital architecture and a coherent roadmap were designed to address fragmentation and inefficiencies in services and programs, laying the foundation for more accessible, effective, and inclusive delivery. UNDP also collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture to secure approval for an institutional roadmap for the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in Moldova. This roadmap is expected to modernize agricultural administration processes and ensure compliance with EU standards. In addition, UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Energy to draft the Digital Transformation Strategy for theEnergy Sector for 2025-2032, which will set a strategic vision for digital innovation and efficient energy management in the coming years. To support local governance, UNDP introduced the Voluntary Amalgamation Online Simulator, enabling LPAs to evaluate amalgamation compliance, identify administrative centers, and estimate financial incentives. This tool promotes transparency, accessibility, and evidence-based decision-making in the amalgamation process. UNDP also made significant strides in localizing Moldova‚Äôs e-governance agenda, enhancing access to and efficiency of public services at the municipal level. As part of these efforts, the ""e-Cancelaria"" electronic document management system was implemented in Cahul and Ungheni, offering 17 public services and processing over 8,700 requests, evenly utilized by businesses (51%) and residents (49%).
