The Action will address the following issues: 
1) Lack of hard data of FLW which show in which VCs and where in the VCs the problem is the most pressing, what the impact is and what the causes are. This lack of concrete information hampers targeted solutions finding and therefore prevents the implementation of a FLW reduction strategy at national level.
2) Lack of skills in measuring, accounting and reporting of FLW at national level. Measuring is essential to know how big the problem is and where, so that policies, strategies and targeted action can be developed.
Project beneficiaries will be trainers, extension specialists and other staff of national institutions, government, NGOs and CSOs, as well as farmer/fisher organizations, food processors, retailers, horeca actors and to some extent household consumers. The project will collaborate with and benefit from external international institutions (e.g., UNDP), providing technical advice and knowledge in FLW measurement and accounting, FLW reduction methodologies, and publicity, awareness raising and information dissemination.

According to the IMF, the country's average consumer price inflation is projected to skyrocket and reach 6.5% in 2022, and these increase in poverty and reduced food affordability and possible food shortages will have a disproportionately more drastic effect on the most vulnerable groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As this downward economic trend in more limited access to food is projected to deteriorate further, the current meal provision services will need to re-assess their capacities and changes in demand not to leave too many needy behind.

FAO and UNDP are implementing this Joint Programme with the following objectives:
‚Ä¢	Assess the impact of the war in Ukraine on smallholder farmers and agri-food producers‚Äô access to finance, seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs and the resulting effects on the past and projected agricultural outputs.
‚Ä¢	Analyze the degree of the country‚Äôs dependence on other import and export markets for key agricultural commodities in the context of the intraregional trade and food security scenarios.
‚Ä¢	Assess food security demand by the most vulnerable as well as map the food centres‚Äô infrastructure and develop concrete recommendations for policy and technical measures that contribute to zero hunger in the country. 
‚Ä¢	Support entity-level institutions and donor partners with evidence-based adaptive contingency planning and emergency response programming in the areas of food security and social protection, with the focus on the access to food by the most vulnerable groups.

These interventions contribute to SDGs 1 and 2, as well as to the UNSDCF Outcomes 1 (Inclusive and sustainable growth) and 3 (Inclusive health and social protection systems).

In close cooperation with the Rural Development Network of North Macedonia, through a consultative and participatory process, FAO and MAFWE conducted the necessary collection of national food security and nutrition data, as well as a detailed analysis of relevant national policies, that will serve as the basis for outlining the future Food Security and Nutrition Strategy. In addition, an institutional survey was conducted in 2022 for developing a proposal to establish a dedicated and permanent inter-institutional national coordination mechanism as a major state body involving all concerned ministries and national agencies to be responsible for the strategic oversight of national food security and nutrition strategy, legislation, policies, and programmes. The implementation of this new policy should contribute to improving the country`s self-sufficiency by increasing sustainable agricultural production and productivity and enhancing distribution, and sharpening the country‚Äôs readiness to react efficiently to the future crisis with an impact on the food security. (Contribution to Output indicator 1.3.10 b) strategies) Full story: www.fao.org/europe/news/detail-news/en/c/1565475/ Quote by Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, Ljupco Nikolovski: ‚Äò‚ÄôFacing the challenges exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war to the domestic food security, the Ministry and the government have recognized the importance of having a National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy as a long-term roadmap of national priorities, actions, and resources needed to promote the country‚Äôs agricultural production, enhance food availability, and improve the affordability of healthy diets for all people in North Macedonia, as well as making food systems sustainable and resilient to future crisis, which may affect the national food security‚Äô‚Äô. UNDP: UN interventions supported development priorities, related strategies and laws in the areas of labour, social services and education. At the project level, interventions directly support the national Operational employment plan through implementation of 5 ALMMs and introduction of innovative pilots in Green Economy.In a joint response to the stagnant integration of Roma, persons with disabilities and youth, as population segments exposed to multiple barriers in accessing the labour market, UN in partnership with MLSP addressed the lack of systematic solution to outsource and financially support measures delivered by non-state service providers. New ‚ÄúLaw on Employment and Insurance in case of Unemployment‚Äù has been drafted to enable ESA to follow and implement recent trends in labour activation of vulnerable, providing instruments for smooth implementation of social contracting model. Concrete policy level interventions in Care economy enabled NGOs to become social service providers for delivery in-home care and respite service as per the protocols agreed previously, along with the measure for Roma returnees, where NGOs are engaged to identify and match potential beneficiaries. Interventions are supported with the Study on GMA aiming to identify benefits and causes hindering labour activation. UN also continued to support social reform by development of rulebooks for guidance and support of the Regional Councils for Social Protection for preparation of Regional Plans, which integrate social service, budgeting and employment of vulnerable groups. In parallel, a Protocol for children at risk was adopted and transfer of knowledge was organized so that local NGOs can become potential service providers.Interventions also support the country‚Äôs EU accession process through, among others, quality standards alignment and the development of standards and licensing if innovative social services. However, beyond the quantitative dimension of effectiveness, introduced models are well under way to producing durable changes.  ",763759.0,695258.95,532766.64,"FAO (TCP/MCD/3805/C4) - FAO in 2022 conducted a thorough evidence-based analysis with recommendations crucial for the formulation of North Macedonia's first National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy. As a final result, the project delivered a comprehensive framework outlining the strategy's key components in 2023. The comprehensive outline of the Strategy was formally validated with pertinent stakeholders at a concluding workshop in May 2023, and included a proposal for the creation of a transparent, accountable, and efficient national inter-institutional food security national coordination mechanism proposing broad participation of stakeholders/actors from state and non-state institutions of different sectors and subsectors (such as agriculture, social protection, development, health, infrastructure, education, finance, industry, and technology). Before it was integrated into the outline strategy the proposed coordinative mechanism was presented in a technical workshop involving relevant stakeholder representatives, who agreed that the leading role should be played by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy with clear intersectoral collaboration. FAO (UNJP/MCD/009/UNJP): The work on Identifying Systemic Pathways for Responding to the Global Crisis on Food, Energy and Finance in North Macedonia, funded by Joint SDG Fund, implemented by UNDP, UNICEF and FAO which started in the second half of 2022 was finalized in early 2023. FAO had a pivotal role as an implementing partner alongside UNDP and UNICEF. FAO contributed by identifying systemic pathways for a more effective response to the food insecurity challenges, particularly related to food accessibility and affordability. To drive sustainable and inclusive transformation in food systems, FAO conducted a comprehensive assessment of data gaps in the country. This served as a foundation for informed decision-making. A consultative workshop brought together 28 representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, farmers' organizations, academia, and the private sector. The aim was to disseminate key findings and recommendations derived from rapid assessments on short and medium-term responses to the ongoing food crisis. FAO conducted data collection on expenditures tied to existing agricultural support measures, including those implemented by the government in response to the crisis. This information formed the basis for insightful recommendations. Additionally, FAO assessed data availability for near-real-time monitoring of food security, providing crucial recommendations to address gaps in the implementation of early forecasting systems, enhancing decision-makers' ability to respond promptly to food production issues and other drivers of food availability. The outcome of FAO's efforts was summarized in three project briefs. These briefs, namely ""Data for estimating near-real-time food availability in North Macedonia,"" ""Food availability through agri-food production and trade in North Macedonia,"" and ""Recommendations for better estimating near-real-time food availability in North Macedonia,"" emphasized key findings and recommendations, particularly for vulnerable groups. Importantly, this FAO intervention harmonized with another TCP project (TCP/MCD/3805/C4), aligning strategically with the preparation of the country‚Äôs first National Food Security Strategy. Both projects exchanged critical data on food security, with a primary focus on food availability and, to some extent, food access (prices and affordability) ‚Äì the foundational pillars of food security.",325790.0,278405.93,242860.78,"UNDP:In 2024, the UN advanced transformative employment initiatives to enhance labour market inclusion for hard-to-employ individuals, including Roma, Roma returnees, and persons with disabilities. Key interventions included activation services, mentorship programs, and localized employment platforms, providing direct support and fostering economic opportunities.A total of 3,785 unemployed individuals benefited from activation services, with Roma employment mentors supporting 2,203 NEET youth, including 505 Roma, 304 Roma returnees, and 1,267 hard-to-employ individuals. Additionally, 2,300 individuals, including persons with disabilities, participated in business skills and entrepreneurship training, leading to new business ventures and economic independence. Roma mentors further facilitated the establishment of 12 small businesses.To strengthen local capacities, the UN introduced socio-economic empowerment models in three municipalities, supporting reintegration policies and business development for marginalized groups. These models provided municipal authorities with structured tools like the ""Model for Local Platforms"" and the ""Protocol for Municipal Platforms,"" enabling coordinated services and holistic support for returnees and vulnerable populations.Skills development remained a priority, with 385 individuals receiving specialized training to improve employability, and 330 certified care providers trained to deliver community-based services. Additionally, an analysis of adult education confirmed its scalability, addressing the needs of over 80,000 individuals without primary education.Active labour market measures (ALMMs) contributed to the creation of 948 new jobs, with 70% secured by women. This included 285 jobs for youth, 197 for Roma, and 19 for persons with disabilities. The UN also supported green job creation, with 158 full-time positions established through sustainable investments in 104 SMEs.By integrating activation services, skills development, and employment models, the UN fostered a more inclusive labour market, ensuring economic opportunities for hard-to-employ individuals while reinforcing systemic solutions for long-term integration.ILO: In 2024, the ILO developed a study that contributes to a better understanding of the phenomenon of labour imbalances and shortages by broadening the discussion beyond the subject of skills mismatches. The main innovation in the report is the introduction of a new measurement of labour imbalances in North Macedonia. The study applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a rich dataset of job vacancy advertisements from the Employment Service Agency and creates an index to capture ""hard-to-fill"" job vacancies, allowing examination of labour shortages across years, occupations, sectors, and regions.

In the longer term, this will result in a reduction of the national contribution to climate change, and a mitigation of the pressure on the national food system for increased production demanded by population and income growth, urbanization and changing consumption prefer-ences and patterns. At the same time, the project would contribute to the FLW regional strat-egy that consists on the formulation of national FLW reduction strategies, and training in FLW measurement, analysis, monitoring, accounting and reporting.
The Action will address the following issues: 
1) Lack of hard data of FLW which show in which VCs and where in the VCs the problem is the most pressing, what the impact is and what the causes are. This lack of concrete infor-mation hampers targeted solutions finding and therefore prevents the implementation of a FLW reduction strategy at national level.
2) Lack of skills in measuring, accounting and reporting of FLW at national level. Measuring is essential to know how big the problem is and where, so that policies, strategies and targeted action can be developed.
Project beneficiaries will be trainers, extension specialists and other staff of national institu-tions, government, NGOs and CSOs, as well as farmer/fisher organizations, food processors, retailers, horeca actors and to some extent household consumers. The project will collaborate with and benefit from external international institutions (e.g., UNDP), providing technical ad-vice and knowledge in FLW measurement and accounting, FLW reduction methodologies, and publicity, awareness raising and information dissemination.

Adequate nutrition has an important effect on health and quality of life. Nevertheless, the burden of disease associated with poor nutrition continues to grow in Europe. Poor diet, overweight and obesity contribute to a large proportion of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in the region. Micronutrient deficiencies and overnutrition in children and adults have become two major food security and nutrition concerns across the region, both of which result in reduced human capacity, and productivity losses. Strengthening the capacity of health institutions responsible for conducting research, policy making and decision-making are recognised as priorities in Montenegro‚Äôs strategy to address NCD. The Nutrition Action Plan (NAP) of Montenegro is focused on creating an environment that promotes proper nutrition, and priority activities are related to promotion of healthy and proper nutrition throughout life, especially for vulnerable groups at the earliest possible stage, including before and during pregnancy. Food consumption statistics in Montenegro are at an early phases of development, while micronutrient intake and bio monitoring research are scarce, especially research on iron, zinc and iodine. Therefore, public health institutions responsible for research and drafting strategic documents need significant technical and professional capacities to undertake integrated actions on risk factors, prevention and control",2020-01-01,2021-12-31,Closed,-,-,IAEA,International Atomic Energy Agency,Technical Cooperation Fund,-,"2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.",2 Zero Hunger,Montenegro,Capacity Development/Technical Assistance,-,-,1 - Contributes to gender equality/women's empowerment in a limited way,,1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights,-,,-,-,-,-,,274000.0,274000,12270,137000.0,98736.05,74295.01,-,36246.33,31708.47,27460.45,-,295244.19,254180.64,211567.41,-,137000.0,108382.44,90178.73,-,137000.0,106290.31,88434.42,Equipment delivered.,148498.104,115904.01,103959.26,-,148498.10400000002,139057.81,103620.91,-,148498.104,134891.24,109389.3,-,148498.104,102568.54,92333.45,-,,,,-,,,,-

-	Reviewing the effectiveness of related existing policies and programmes
-	Identifying the opportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration between stakeholders (UN agencies, academia, civil society, government in particular)
2) the WHO Regional Office for Europe has developed a classification to guide countries in restricting food marketing: the WHO Regional Office for Europe nutrient profile model (WHO NP). Use of the WHO NP model can assist in evaluating the status of HFSS food marketing in Member States and determining the effectiveness of existing initiatives and approaches to restricting such marketing.
Despite all the efforts, exposure to marketing of unhealthy products remains a major issue, demanding to protect all children equally. 
Children are likely to be exposed to advertisements while watching TV. It is important to get an idea of the extent this is happening. And  research on the current situation is the first monitoring step recommended to be taken by Member States.
Therefore, WHO CO AZE supported the Research on the TV marketing of unhealthy food products targeting children in Azerbaijan.  For this purposes, WCO AZE supported training of three researchers in previous year,  and starting from June 2023, they started recording, analysing and coding TV programmes from 4 channels popular among children.

This support included (i) strengthening the Ministry of Emergency Situations' warehousing capacity by improving the infrastructure of its two warehouses to establish standard conditions for emergency food stock management, (ii) training staff on international safety standards for handling, prepositioning, and storing emergency food stock, and (iii) developing and integrating standard operational procedures for the creation and management of emergency food stocks into the national social and civil protection systems. Additionally, WFP supported the Ministries in continuing a pilot project on prepositioning individual food kits tailored to meet the nutritional needs of people in remote mountainous areas during emergencies. In 2024, with WFP's support, the Ministries endorsed the composition of emergency food kits, which include ready-to-eat commodities designed to sustain one person for up to ten days during emergencies. WFP procured 300 parcels to test and refine the mechanism of food prepositioning in 2025. Following the pilot, a national budget allocation is expected to support the scale-up of these individual food kits. A well-composed food basket will help maintain the nutritional status of individuals during emergencies when they are primarily dependent on food aid.Additionally, WFP continued to collaborate with relevant stakeholders in contingency planning, training, research, and information management. As the lead agency for the Food Security and Logistics sector of the Disaster Response Coordination Unit (DRCU), WFP participated in an emergency simulation exercise organized by the Ministry of Emergency Situations.

While unique to a country there are many underlying principles and competencies required to have a comprehensive and efficient system. Agreed international guidance is available to guide governments to build robust food control systems and measure them, including the Codex Principles on Food Control systems, and the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool. 
While the food control system in the Republic of Belarus is well-developed, similar to many countries, it needs to be kept up to date based on the latest scientific principles and evidence. Applying the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool allows the designated competent authorities in Belarus ‚Äì the MoH, the MoAF and the Gosstandart ‚Äì to work in a coordinated manner to assess the current system and form a common and comprehensive position on the core strengths in the system, versus the areas in need of improvement. The results of the assessment are important for the sustainable and continuous improvement of the food control system. This comprehensive analysis underlies a successful strategic investment plan and food safety vision.
Having this common position and action plan is powerful and secures a long term vision to be reached through deeper collaboration and coordinated actions across the health, agriculture, veterinary and food standards sectors, which is required for a ‚Äúfarm to fork‚Äù, risk-based, preventive system of control for safe food. In turn, the action plan will enable continuous improvement and targeted strategic investments.
The Government of the Republic of Belarus has demonstrated its commitment and willingness to collaborate with FAO under this particular project, and the specific need identified is to further strengthen collaboration between MoH, MoAF and Gosstandart to agree on common goals for an improved food control system, agree on current strengths and gaps and to co-develop an investment plan to address the gaps. 
To enable the Republic of Belarus to implement improvements in the food control system, update and strengthen its food safety strategy, under the current project FAO will provide the following support: 
i) Facilitate the development of an action plan for continuous food safety improvement, using the results of the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool;
ii) Support coordinated investments in the official food control system.

Across the globe, generations have shaped their local identities through typical food products and landscapes that showcase the interplay between natural resources and production systems. Today these connections between products, places and people not only represent a heritage worth preserving ‚Äì thanks in part to geographical indications (GIs) ‚Äì but also possess inherent market value, as consumers increasingly seek quality linked to geographical origin, tradition, and specific producers.
Furthermore, an effective GI organization can significantly enhance the success of the geographical indication process by coordinating the value chain and stakeholders, thereby increasing the bargaining power of the stakeholder group (GIs associations), providing economies of scale in supply services or goods and enhancing market transparency.
Therefore, promoting connections between local producers, their regions and their products through geographical indications is recognized as a vital pathway to creating nutritious food systems and fostering sustainable development in rural communities worldwide.
In recent decades, the Republic of Belarus has increasingly integrated into the global economy, encountering both opportunities and challenges for sustainable rural development. 
The country has significant potential to further enhance its capabilities by adopting advanced marketing practices and information technologies in its agriculture sector. In this context, the development of the GI system could be a catalyst for creating sustainable value chains and fostering rural development. With appropriate technical assistance, the GI system can empower local stakeholders, strengthen value chain linkages, promote quality products, and improve access to more lucrative markets.
The Law of the Republic of Belarus ""On Geographical Indications"" governs the relationships related to the legal protection and use of geographical indications. The term ""geographical indication"" encompasses both appellation of origin and indication of source. Considering a limited number of GIs registered in the country (only one national product (the Mineral Water ""Minskaya""), and 30 international products are registered in Belarus), FAO‚Äôs support is essential to raise awareness about the importance of GI products and provide a deeper understanding of the benefits for producers, encouraging their engagement. As gender considerations cannot be traced in the registered GI applications, it is not possible to understand the roles of both, men and women, as GI producers or, verify any specific interest to produce or promote an origin-based product. Therefore, as part of future analysis, it will be important to investigate roles and weaknesses that hinder farmers -women, youth or men from taking active part in supporting local development through geographical indications. 
As it is also important to support gender equality in the field of geographical indications and support young farmers and women-farmers to participate in agriculture, FAO is determined to engage with men, women and youth in this project, find the gaps and weaknesses that would hinder youth or women from taking part and develop in this field of agriculture, therefore the training sessions and workshops will be organized in a gender-sensitive way so that both men and women beneficiaries will be able to attend, and gender-related concerns will be mainstreamed in the workshop/document‚Äôs content.

However, in rural areas, agriculture remains the primary source of income, albeit with significantly lower wages compared to urban regions and industrial sectors. As a result, the rural population has been steadily shrinking over the past decades, dropping from 23 percent of the total population in 2013 to just 19 percent in 2023 .
Moreover, lower wages, limited job opportunities and inadequate living conditions also make living in the rural areas especially unpopular to the younger generations. While regarding children, the age distribution of the urban and rural populations has only two percentage points of difference (18.4 percent in urban and 16.4 percent in rural areas), the share of elderly is significantly higher in rural areas (30 percent) than in urban areas (21.1percent) . Thus, the Government of Belarus has made it a priority to focus more on rural youth to learn more about their needs and the challenges they face. By generating new knowledge and insights into the situation of rural youth, decision-makers in Belarus will be able to produce more efficient, evidence-based youth policies. After recognizing the need to bridge this knowledge gap, the Government has requested support from the FAO REU Office to collaborate on gathering comprehensive data on the specific needs of rural young women and men - especially young farmers - who are crucial for maintaining rural communities. 
The project will result in an analysis report on the situation and needs of rural youth. This study will provide a detailed understanding of the socioeconomic and environmental landscape of rural youth in Belarus, taking into account the gender differences, enabling the design of tailored and effective strategies, policies and interventions. Insights from this research will lead to the formulation of policy recommendations, drawing also on international good practices as well as discussions with crucial local stakeholders. The project will aim at building on the results achieved under three related projects, namely TCP/BYE/3703/C2 project titled Support for rural development policy assessment and community development feasibility study, specifically considering the main outcomes of the feasibility study as well as the policy recommendations; TCP/BYE/3802 titled Promoting women's entrepreneurship in rural areas, specifically on the findings and recommendations of the ‚Äú National gender profile of agriculture and rural livelihoods‚Äù conducted under this project, and of TCP/BYE/3803/C3 titled Promotion of Local Markets, specifically on the findings and recommendations of the technical report on ‚ÄòThe Landscape of Digital Agrifood Markets in Belarus: state of the art, challenges and opportunities‚Äù.

When food goes to waste, all the resources used in its production such as water, energy and land are also wasted along with the emissions generated. GHGs contribute to an unstable climate prone to drastic environmental change and extreme weather events. These unstable climate conditions negatively impact crop yields, reduce the nutritional quality of crops, disrupt supply chains, and threaten food security. Halving FLW would help Azerbaijan realize its NDC commitments and meet Target 12.3 of the SDGs, which calls to cut FLW in half by 2030, as well as improve food security and nutrition and ease pressure on natural resources. Prevention and reduction of FLW contributes to climate change mitigation, increases food availability, and minimizes economic losses for affected food supply chain actors. FLW lowers productivity and that is transmitted through food prices. Therefore, prevention and reduction of food losses have downstream and upstream impacts. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that economic decisions underlie much of FLW and that measurement needs to improve and should account for both quantity and quality losses. Leveraging social and technological innovation for food and agriculture ‚Äì focused on FLW prevention and reduction ‚Äì is of paramount importance to scale up solutions that can drive systemic changes.

In the energy efficiency area, the activities covered the assessment of energy consumption of small businesses in rural areas to identify key patterns and develop targeted assistance for introduction of energy efficiency measures. Moreover, the current JP targeted the existing social protection scheme related to agricultural workers, its challenges and possible improvements.In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the results achieved through this program, the JP also envisages provision of capacity building activities (based on the results of the institutional assessment of relevant government entities conducted in the framework of JP) and coaching sessions for relevant staff of government agencies to deploy developed analytical tools and assessment methodologies for future efficient and informed decision-making in response to cost of living crisis and other challenges.  More specifically, UN agencies (UNDP, ILO, FAO and UNECE) have delivered the following results in close collabporation and intensive communication with key beneficiaries:UNDP¬∑      UNDP developed analytical tools for assessment of impact of food and energy prices and other factors on vulnerable population and achieving SDG targets 1 and 2.

FAO¬∑      In order to identify challenges of current agricultural data collection, FAO conducted rapid assessment of the existing data collection and analysis tools. ¬∑      Moreover, FAO identified 4 main stakeholders ‚Äì Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture (MEPA), National Statistics Office of Georgia, Regional Services of the Rural Development Agency (under MEPA) and Georgian Farmers Association. The work with relevant stakeholders continues to assess the identified challenges in data collection and adopt relevant recommendations. ¬∑      Derived from the results of the survey the project has made addition to the existing report to determine the current and potential impacts of food security in Georgia and also to use the forecasting of food security indicators. Namely, indicators of self-sufficiency of selected agricultural products and their forecast for 2025 and 2030; also Global Hunger Index (GHI) indicator and Expenditures on Food in Georgia.¬∑      Training needs assessment of the Geostat and MEPA staff was conducted and following thematic priorities for the trainings were identified: -         Time series forecasting, using Python or EViews programs-         Building and forecasting a regression model using agricultural data-         Based on statistical information and evidence development of the business plans in agriculture and interpretation of financial and non-financial indicators -         Improving the quality and quantity of food stocks (methodology, conversion rate)¬∑      Consultations with MEPA and Geostat have started about the establishment of an Interagency Coordination Group for data analysis and exchange of operative and official data. UNECE¬∑      UNECE conducted assessment of energy consumption by small businesses in rural areas of Georgia, providing energy consumption patterns for food producing and food processing small businesses operating in rural areas. Also, energy consumption benchmarks for various essential food products were identified.¬∑      Following the assessment, UNECE prepared recommendations to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency by small businesses in rural areas. ¬∑      UNECE also developed case studies with targeted assistance for small businesses in selected rural areas in Georgia to introduce energy efficiency measures.ILO¬∑      In consultations with the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons, Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia (MoLHSA), ILO assessed the current institutional system for receiving requests for social benefits and sources of information for agricultural workers. The assessment also included research of 2020 situation, namely challenges faced by market traders and sellers to access special Covid-19 social protection benefits.¬∑      In response to identified challenges and shortcomings of the system, ILO has elaborated methodology for assessment of extension of social protection schemes (maternity benefits, targeted social assistance (TSA)) for workers in agriculture. Up to date, it can be assumed that 2/3 of the planned tasks and goals are implemented. The final stage of implementation, planned for the first quarter of 2023, will focus on practical application of designed tools and recommendations, including by developing new/adjusting existing policy response measures and programs to address food and energy security issues for the most vulnerable and lay solid foundation for efficient policy response for future challenges.

Upon approval of the manuals by the inspection agencies, salt producers and inspection agencies were trained on internal and external monitoring of salt iodization. UNICEF in close collaboration with Tojikstandard and SES conducted regional workshops covering all districts of the country. The objective of the workshop was to build the capacity of the inspection agencies to set up strong supervision and enforcement mechanism. Over 200 staff of the national, regional and districts offices of Tojikistandard and SES attended workshops in Khatlon, Sughd, GBAO, Districts of Republican Subordinate (DRS) and Dushanbe. Furthermore, UNICEF supported SES in the production of quarterly salt iodization inspection reports, which were shared with the salt procurers and respective national and regional authorities to take necessary actions. Improved capacity of inspection agencies following the training enabled increased frequency of reporting on quality of iodised salt and implementation of the USI strategy. UNICEF also facilitated strong coordination and collaboration between these government agencies and clarified each of their roles and responsibilities in relation to the national universal salt iodization programme. UNICEF provided technical support to TOJISKTANDARD in development of a USI web-based monitoring system. The web-based monitoring system is intended to enable real time monitoring and reporting of salt quality by the agency at both the production and at the market level.

Stakeholder engagement meetings to date have had equitable participation from women and men and issues highlighted by both women and men have therefore been considered in the development of this project. However, in order to ensure that relevant sectors, which are often dominated by women (e.g. livestock production in some countries) are represented in stakeholder engagement meetings and training events, the project will avail of different approaches and tools to optimize engagement from all relevant stakeholders.  Country level assessments will be undertaken at several points in the project, firstly in gauging current levels of awareness on AMR and then the regulatory situation, surveillance and lab capacity and practices in target production systems. In designing the surveys and questionnaires, input will be sought on how to optimally capture gender related information that may impact the outcome of the survey. In assessing the data, the granularity of information will be maintained to the extent possible in the analysis in order to try and determine if and to what extent aspects such as gender, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity etc. impact a particular situation.

However, in terms of translating that into a regulatory framework where consideration of those that will implement the measures on the ground needs to be take account. Several aspects of gender may need to be considered here including its impact on implementation and support to implementation as well as of oversight and monitoring of implementation, recognizing that in some contexts women many be perceived as not having adequate knowledge or authority and therefore may require specific or additional support. In addition, analysis of the data from baseline studies relevant to good practices will help ensure that good practice guidance is tailored to needs of those engaged in particular value-chains in beneficiary countries. Therefore, when indicated by the local context, training and implementation support will consider the particular role of   women and men, recognizing that this may vary for different parts of the chain.

These interventions are an important part of a comprehensive package to eliminate morbidity due to soil-transmitted helminths and to improve health and nutrition, especially among the most at-risk populations. The campaign will be conducted in 2024 and will benefit 5.5 million children aged two through twelve years old.   Micronutrient deficiencies among children remained a UNICEF priority in 2023. UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Government of Uzbekistan in planning for a school feeding programme to address malnutrition and improve nutritional status, especially among vulnerable children. Additionally, UNICEF established a partnership with the Delivery Unit at the Agency of Strategic Reforms to review and revise the program on Universal Salt Iodization to prevent and control iodine deficiency disorders among population.",116666.66666666667,95331.19,84691.07,-,116666.66666666667,77290.33,65946.86,-,,,,-,,,,-
