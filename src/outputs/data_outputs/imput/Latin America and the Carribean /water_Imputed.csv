The project addresses the sensitive energy, water, food and climate nexus in the Metropolitan Region of Recife (RMR) by promoting the use of organic waste to energy solutions (WTE). The project is of cross-sectoral nature and contributes to the implementation of several federal, state-level and urban policies and regulations, such as the Solid Waste Plan of RMR, the State Plan for Solid Residues of Pernambuco, the Recife Sanitation Plan, the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), as well as the recently adopted 2050 National Energy Plan with its ambitious renewable energy targets. Solid waste management, water and sanitation, energy security and climate change adaptation are major interrelated concerns of the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco (RMR), which includes 15 municipalities, provides livelihood for around 4 million people and hosts major industries in the region. The overall objective of the project is to address the energy, water, food and climate nexus by promoting the use of organic waste to energy (WTE) solutions in the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco (RMR). The project comprises a 16 months preparatory phase, which foresees the development of relevant assessments for two pilot projects and the formulation of a project document for the main phase. The preparatory phase includes the following results: 1.

This approach aims to deliver ecological, social, and economic benefits, supporting Amazon riparian countries in meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs) and convention targets. The Project operates through four key Components:
The Project is being executed through four Components:
Component 1 will strengthen the current national and regional institutional IWRM framework and develop a financial sustainability strategy to facilitate fund raising for SAP implementation, as well as ACTO‚Äôs role in conservation finance for improved IWRM. 
Components 2 will build community resilience to address the impacts of climate change in the Amazon Basin in order to reduce damages from extreme climactic events; ensure water security in the context of adaptation to climate change; and enhance resilience of coastal ecosystems. The component will also touch on the issues of infrastructure resilience in the context of climate change, promoting technical dialogue on infrastructure resilience and sustainability, facilitating exchange of best practices on risk analysis and environmental impact assessment and improving understanding of the Nexus and progress towards achievement of SDG9 in the Amazon basin. 
Component 3 will implement integrated environmental and water resources monitoring systems in order to establish basin wide compatible information to guide science-to-policy decision-making in IWRM and for conservation and protection of the bio-aquatic ecosystems. A supplement to the existing TDA/SAP and National Action Plans (NAP) using TWAP indicators will facilitate interconnections between national and regional activities, supporting national reports related to international conventions and SDGs. 
Component 4 provides project management tools, as well as a system to monitor SAP implementation over time. This component will also promote project visibility within the Amazon Basin and worldwide, facilitating ACTO‚Äôs positioning and recognition as an IWRM coordination agency for the Amazon Basin.
The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) is the Executing Agency for the Project. National government partners include: Ministries of Foreign Affairs in the 8 basin countries, Ministry of Environment and Water (Bolivia), National Water and Basic Sanitation Agency (Brazil), Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Colombia), Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (Ecuador), Ministry of Agriculture / Hydromet Service (Guyana), National Water Authority (Peru), Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment (Suriname), and the People‚Äôs Power Ministry for Eco-socialism and the PP Ministry of Atention to Water (Venezuela).

In this sense, the upcoming National SAP Implementation Workshops in the 8 Amazonian countries will include training on gender in IWRM.  In all its activities, the project is implementing the Gender Action Plan. In terms of Capacity building and training, the National Project Focal Points and main stakeholders participating at the Project Launch webinar attended a presentation on Incorporating gender mainstreaming in SAP implementation delivered by UNESCO WWAP. Furthermore, the ACTO team was engaged in two-day Capacity building in gender and human rights, sponsored by the GIZ, levelling the conceptual ground and introducing the main issues of gender mainstreaming both at the institutional and project implementation levels. This was the first step in enhancing the capacity of ACTO to promote gender-responsive approaches and gender mainstreaming in its projects.

The SP/ACTO organized the Second Meeting of the Project Steering Committee, held in person at ACTO Headquarters in Brasilia, on March 1-2, 2023, and attended by the 8 Member Countries. The PSC approved the Annual Project Progress Report (2022), the Work Plan for the year 2023, and the corresponding Project Budget. The PSC, following the conclusions of the Regional Workshop: Water Resources Monitoring in the Framework of SAP Implementation held in parallel, also addressed issues related to water resources monitoring in the Basin, and recommended to establish strategic alliances, support knowledge transfer to the countries and create and strengthen technical capacities for the use of satellite data in Water Resources monitoring in the Amazon. Also, to support common indicators and protocols for hydrological, water quality and ETS monitoring and standardized data exchange for the Amazon Basin within the framework of ACTO, based on global indicators such as those of the SDGs, GEMS Water and TWAP. Finally, manage through ACTO a capacity building package with UNEP, WMO and IHP on Water Resources Monitoring for IWRM.   The Project has a fully established governance and execution structure with consolidated Regional Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and 8 National Project Coordination Units (NPCU) with technical focal points appointed from different national institutions in support of project interventions and regional activities, and 8 National Assistants. The PCU and the NPCU meet quarterly to ensure the same understanding regarding the progress in the execution of the project activities, share lessons learned and challenges and to establish short term planning of activities. In this sense, three Technical Meetings of the Coordinators of the NPCU and National Assistants were held during the reporting period.   The project has supported the active exchange and coordination among the basin countries oriented to strengthening national and regional water governance. In this regard, a technical visit to the premises of the National Water Agency of Brazil, including a meeting with the Director-President of ANA, a visit to the Water situation room and the Center for calibration and testing of monitoring equipment, was carried out with the participation of the delegates from the 8 MC. The technical visit was an opportunity for ANA to showcase the Agency¬¥s experience, technological advances, methodologies and processes in water resources monitoring and management, and for countries to exchange views on IWRM issues. Also, and specifically oriented to supporting Guyana and Suriname in establishing national water authorities, the Project organized bilateral visits from both countries to ANA-Brazil, including a capacity building course on Water Law and Governance and coordination for bilateral cooperation. At the end of the reporting period, the eight riparian countries have confirmed a schedule of National SAP Implementation Workshops including training on gender mainstreaming in IWRM.   The project also made progress in increasing the adaptive capacity of communities and ecosystems to the impacts of climate change through the activities oriented to establishing transboundary Early Warning Systems in the MAP region (Bolivia, Brazil, Peru); designing and implementing alternative water supply solutions in the scenarios of the melting Andean snowcaps of Bolivia and Peru; formulating groundwater use and protection policies for Leticia (Colombia) and Tabatinga (Brazil); and monitoring groundwater in important urban aquifers of the Madeira basin in Bolivia.   The binational intervention in Leticia and Tagatinga (Colombia-Brazil) has been successfully executed, achieving all planned targets. The final binational workhop was held in Tabatinga, Brazil (June 2023), with the participation of more than 40 stakeholders including National Water Directors, Mayors, authorities from the municipal and state governments, water users, etc. In order to ensure sustainability of the binational groundwater monitoring network, the local governments committed to include the implementation of the automatic groundwater monitoring network in the agenda of the ""Brazil-Colombia Binational Integration and Neighborhood Commission,"" and to dedicate technical teams and equipment to monitor both surface and groundwater.   At the same time, in partnership with national institutions and universities, the Project advanced in establishing glacier retreat monitoring and assessment in Tuni Condoriri, Huayna Potosi, and Milluni glaciers located within the drainage basins of the densely-populated La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia, and in the Apollobamba and Carabaya Snowy Mountain Ranges, in Peru. A total of three field reconnaissance trips were held to the intervention areas during the reporting period. Monitoring equipment has been purchased and will be installed during the next reporting period. An institutional launching workshop was held in La Paz (June 2023).   In Bolivia, the diagnostic on local aquifers and groundwater was completed, and 6 institutional agreements concluded. The perforation of wells for the groundwater monitoring network has been concluded in the Sacaba aquifer system, and is in its final stage in Santa Cruz aquifer. The project has also carried out awareness raising activities in local schools.   Activities oriented to promote climate-smart agricultural practices, early warning systems and NBS to address the effects of floods in the Casiquiare - R√≠o Negro basin, in Venezuela, also started. As well as the national intervention in Brazil: Ecological restoration and payment for socio-environmental services in the Xingu river basin.   The Amazonian countries have advanced in the transboundary cooperation to jointly monitor and assess the quantity and quality of Amazon water resources, as they agreed to establish the Regional Water Quality Monitoring Network (with 111 monitoring points and 9 physical-chemical parameters to be analyzed) and the Amazon Hydrological Network (RHA), based on 343 monitoring points to be implemented in two phases, under the co-financing initiative Amazonas Project: Regional Action in the Area of Water Resources (OTCA-ANA/ABC-Brazil). Data from these regional networks can already be visualized at the Amazon Regional Observatory (oraotca.org). In this context, a regional report on the Situation of Water Quality in the Amazon Basin has been prepared and launched, and a proposal for a regional protocol on data collection, storage and sharing is being proposed.   In order to ensure synergies and complementation of activities with the main ACTO initiatives related to regional monitoring in the Amazon, the Project team has been supporting the process of establishing the Water Resources and Regional Networks Modules in the context of the Amazon Regional Observatory (ORA), as well as the structuring of a Water Situation Room at ACTO.   During the reporting period, the Project, in partnership with IRD and the University of Brasilia, started the development of a Mercury Panorama in the Amazon and an Atlas of Mercury contamination incidence based on Mercury pollution sources, which will provide data and information to the Integrated Regional Platform of IWRM and orient the design of a basin-wide Mercury monitoring system based on hot spots, as part of the Amazon water quality monitoring network.   Regarding the future supplement to the TDA/SAP and specifically the possibility of including a component on water supply and sanitation services, the Project team has been coordinating with the initiative Regional Transboundary Action Plan on drinking water, basic sanitation and solid waste management (ACTO/IDB).   Finally, the broad project goal of strengthening IWRM and regional coordination mechanism in the Amazon Basin is expected to be addressed by the Presidents of the 8 ACTO Member Countries at the IV Summit of the Presidents of the States Parties of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty to be held in Belem, Brazil, on August 8-9, 2023.   Due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 on socio-economic dynamics in the Amazonian countries, there has been an overall delay in the start and initial execution of the project outputs. For this reason, the PSC recommended the extension of the Project duration until December 2025.   Considering the high level of commitment and active involvement of the basin countries in the formulation of the SAP and the design of the current project and high level of participation in the Project activities, as well as the current process of strengthening ACTO, the overall risk rating of the project is considered as Low.

The primary objective of this technical assistance Project is to pinpoint areas most vulnerable to droughts and subsequent water variability and shortages through drought risk assessment and mapping. Under the Project, the Project will:  i) assess drought risk and water resources and Issue risk maps through Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software to identify the area‚Äôs most at risk of droughts; ii) map aquifers suitable for recharge; iii) design a fully integrated system that will enable Suriname to recharge its aquifer in time of drought in a sustainable, clean, and safe manner; and iv) train national officers in the use of the drought prevention model and in the designed system to manage the water resources in the aquifer in time of drought (see: https://www.ctc-n.org/technical-assistance/projects/enhance-resilience-suriname-s-water-supply-system-modelling-drought)",2024-09-20,2025-12-31,Implementation,-,-,UNEP,United Nations Environment Programme,United Nations Environment Programme,Climate Technology Centre and Network; Suriname NIMOS; United Nations Environment Programme,13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.,13 Climate Action,Suriname,Capacity Development/Technical Assistance,-,-,1 - Contributes to gender equality/women's empowerment in a limited way,,1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights,-,,-,-,-,Deirdre Shurland,,193050,193050,31300.0,96525.0,74884.66,62856.72,-,96525.0,71206.44,67427.1,-,96525.0,77976.18,62419.9,-,96525.0,88828.24,61568.23,-,96525.0,70266.95,45468.27,-,96525.0,77239.27,65541.25,-,96525.0,80115.36,75706.2,-,96525.0,72372.68,66790.09,-,31300.0,23975.84,19388.31,-,161750.0,138757.51,107022.59,-,,,,-,,,,-
