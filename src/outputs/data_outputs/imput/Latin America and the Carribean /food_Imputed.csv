In parallel with the provision of cash, voucher and food assistance support in the Virgin Islands (UK), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Dominica and Barbados, WFP worked on strengthening national capacities for registration, vulnerability analysis, delivery mechanisms, monitoring and reconciliation of food, voucher and cash assistance and facilitated trainings in shock responsive social protection to improve the capacity of countries to respond to shock:Specifically, in Barbados, WFP provided technical assistance and guidance for targeting, verification and consolidation of the assistance recipients, and outreach, as well as human resources and technical expertise on logistics through its supply chain team and transportation assets by working together with the government to develop a distribution plan for social assistance. This support built on existing capacities and social protection systems utilized by the Government, further improving and strengthening ability to respond to shocks in the future. WFP also continued supporting the Government of Barbados to strengthen digital payment reconciliation processes, digital data collection and post-distribution monitoring by carrying out trainings for the Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs (MPEA) staff. 115 tablets were donated by WFP to the MPEA to further assist with these efforts.Furthermore, in Saint Lucia WFP developed and piloted a household vulnerability index aimed at informing response planning for shock-responsive social protection and overall social protection systems strengthening. The pilot tested the identification, targeting and delivery of social assistance to vulnerable persons affected by Hurricane Elsa and tested a new digital payment mechanism. The lessons learned from the pilot will inform the government‚Äôs efforts to strengthen social protection in response to shocks in Saint Lucia and across the Caribbean and to also expand Saint Lucia‚Äôs learning on how digital payments can be used to support the delivery of cash assistance to vulnerable persons before and after a shock.Additionally, In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, WFP has provided technical support and guidance to the Government in the targeting, verification, and consolidation of the beneficiary list for WFP cash assistance and the World Bank's 6-month cash programme. The programme aims to assist approximately over 3,500 households affected by the volcanic eruption in 2021. WFP has engaged with the Ministry of National Mobilization in discussions to identify gaps in previous programmes, resulting in a technical agreement to strengthen the system to reduce poverty and vulnerability, increase resilience, and provide assistance to those affected by the shock that will be signed in 2023.With the establishment of the La Soufri√®re Relief Grant in 2021, the government was able to secure longer-term support for recipients through World Bank financing, with assistance extended for an additional six months. This was made possible by the improvements to the registration, verification, and vulnerability assessment processes, as well as ongoing monitoring, revision, and updating of the beneficiary list, which has increased the accuracy and accessibility of information through digitalization. WFP will continue to provide technical assistance in the delivery of cash assistance funded by the World Bank as the efforts shift back towards capacity building Lessons learned:-     Online channels should be considered for beneficiary registration, as manual forms can lead to inaccurate data collection with potential negative impact on provision of support to people in need. In addition, all requisite information for complete/comprehensive database of persons to be paid should be collected in a consolidated manner from the onset as participants can become difficult to reach which can impact the ability to create a database of beneficiaries-     The establishment of a data working group can be useful to foster coordination among different government ministries/entities. -     Where relevant, consider using a combination of payment modalities based on beneficiary preference.-     Strengthening the range of communication channels is essential to ensure that all beneficiaries are aware of what is being communicated and take swift action as necessary.",209529.0,156596.09,108798.78,"In 2023, WFP continued to work closely with governments within the region to strengthen social protection systems to respond to shocks. Progress has been made in strengthening critical areas of social protection systems such as data and information management, beneficiary targeting and delivery mechanisms to enable governments to better meet the needs of impacted populations in times of crisis in the following countries:  In Barbados, technical assistance was provided to the Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs to conceptualize and implement a research agenda on digital financial inclusion to explore the potential of digital payments for social protection. The joint research activity aims to provide the Government of Barbados with analysis on the current state of the digital financial ecosystem in Barbados with the view of exploring the use of digital payment modalities for improved social protection delivery and rapid scale-ups in emergencies. This support by WFP complements previous efforts since 2020 to strengthen social protection in Barbados and contributes to assisting the Government i transition towards a digital economy.  In collaboration with the Ministry of Equity in Saint Lucia, WFP is actively engaged in advancing digital payments for social protection.  Beginning with the successful testing of digital payments during an emergency in 2022, WFP brought together 61 beneficiaries of the Public Assistance Programme, as well as suppliers and government officials to solicit perspectives and insights into the use of digital payments for the delivery of assistance through social protection systems. The research also considers the use of digital finance options taking into consideration age, gender and geographic location, amongst other factors.  These efforts provide important information that can shape a more gender-responsive approach to strengthening social protection in the country.  Parallel to providing cash assistance to meet the nutritional needs of people impacted by the 2022 trough system in Dominica, systems strengthening support was provided to the government to improve targeting, delivery and verification capacities to enable the government to better meet the needs of the most vulnerable. WFP helped to improve how data from registration and verification processes would inform targeting and strategies for delivery of payments. Post distribution monitoring assistance was also provided to the government through training and focus group discussions with beneficiaries who received assistance under the Trough cash assistance programme. In the Virgin Islands (UK) WFP  partnered with the government to provide comprehensive technical assistance for the digitalization of the national social protection program, including the design and implementation of the new Public Assistance Programme (PAP).  WFP worked with  the Social Development Department (SDD) to conduct a thorough review of the services provided under the existing PAP, and its end-to-end process.  The review was able to identify weaknesses in the existing process and to identify the data and information needs along programmes cycles to move towards a more efficient and accountable process. A detailed Standard Operating Procedures to clarify roles, clarify definitions on targeting and supportive documentation needed etc. was developed and WFP provided technical support to create a first version of a digital system based on the review process with a flexibility built-in to allow for its adaptation to future regulation. This support consisted of the development, testing and improving of digital data collection tools at each step of the process, connected through a system of unique identifier for the client, and unique request number to track separately each request from intake to closure. An online database was designed, that pulls information automatically from the digital forms, making analysis easier, both for case management and for reporting purposes at a division level.  Client paper-based files are now digitized, allowing for easy access to the cases and reducing the volume of paper files.  In collaboration with the SDD team WFP facilitated trainings for different users of the system on the new process, their refined role, and the use of the tools. WFP also compiled user-guides for each role, that clearly describe in detail the step-by step process for managing cases through the system. The system was launched in February starting with registering new requests into the system and transitioning existing beneficiaries of the new PAP. Since the launch, improvements to the system were implemented along its development cycle, with WFP playing the role of facilitator between the SDD team and the Virgin Islands (UK) Health Services Authority. Developing the system in a relatively simple technical version first, enables the government to test the overall viability of the process, as its flexibility allows for rapid modifications of the system whenever weaknesses and solutions are identified. Once the system‚Äôs back-bone is tested and validated by all stakeholders, it can be used as the basis for the development of a proper software that will allow for more functionalities. The development of such software is a lengthy process, and the interim system will be used until that software is developed, tested and validated.   Lesson learned:  St Lucia  The feedback from the beneficiaries who took part in the focus group discussions indicated a preference for traditional payment modes. This underscores the significance of conducting thorough assessments of community attitudes and preferences before designing and implementing social protection programmes.  Dominica Digital payments to beneficiaries should be explored as they enhance convenience and contribute to financial inclusion and transparency. A dedicated hotline or digital platform is recommended to allow beneficiaries to submit complaints and feedback easily and enhance the Complaints and Feedback Mechanism.  Virgin Islands (UK)  System development requires a simple and iterative approach. For example,  the use of simpler, off-the-shelf tools such as Kobo for intake and Excel for storage was fundamental to setting the foundation for improving systems in the Virgin Islands.   A comprehensive assessment to review processes and capacities within social protection systems are necessary prerequisites for the digitalization process. Only after establishing this foundational knowledge and building a common roadmap to realize the envisioned change can tools and technologies, and subsequent ‚Äòdigitization‚Äô efforts occur. This proposed approach ensures that digital enhancements are built upon solid, well-understood processes and protocols.",220991.0,158257.7,130081.35,-,220991.0,175719.17,141755.05,-,,,,-,,,,-

WFP carries out activities to enhance social protection systems at the national level to increase their capacity to reduce poverty and vulnerability and provide assistance to shock-affected people. WFP Caribbean‚Äôs work on capacity strengthening includes regional learning, knowledge exchanges and training efforts and in 2022, WFP administered shock-responsive social protection trainings for government partners in Barbados, Saint Lucia and Dominica , with the aim of enhancing participant's understanding of social protection, disaster risk management, and how preparation, response and mitigation of impacts from shocks are linked. Trainings on data management and digitization were also provided in the countries:-         In Barbados, a total of 19 people were trained (18 females and 1 male) under shock-responsive social protection and on December 19 persons were trained on the use of a digital data collection tool for the tracking of a countrywide food hamper distribution. WFP continued supporting the Government of Barbados to strengthen digital payment reconciliation processes, digital data collection and post-distribution monitoring by carrying out trainings for Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs (MPEA) staff. WFP donated 115 tablets to the MPEA to further assist with these efforts. -         In Dominica, WFP provided technical assistance piloting digital data collection registration for the public assistance programme. A training was also conducted on shock responsive social protection and a workshop on the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for shock-responsive social protection. A total of 18 and 22 individuals participated in the training sessions respectively. -         In the Virgin Islands (UK) WFP supported the implementation of the House of Assembly (HOA) Transitional Grant. This transition moved social grants previously under the House of Assembly to the Social Development Department (SDD), in a reform to increase accountability, efficiency, and inclusion. WFP provided technical support to the SDD to review the process of the delivery chain of Public Assistance, and to digitalize it (digital data collection, analysis of data to establish eligibility and grants amount, and delivery and monitoring of assistance delivery). Substantial progress was made in strengthening social protection information management systems, using a twin-track approach to meeting immediate information management needs with the House of Assembly transition of social grants previously under the HOA to the Social Development Department, while setting the base for a more comprehensive system. A mission was undertaken by WFP‚Äôs Senior Information Management Systems Advisor and technical support provided to the government to develop an interim digital system (the development, piloting, refinement and implementation of digital data collection forms, the development of the database, Training of the implementation team with the new methodology). These elements are enabling efficient and accountable information management processes within the accelerated timeline for implementation of the HOA Transitional Grant. Digital data collection processes enable disaggregation by sex and other characteristics, strengthening opportunities for gender-response analysis.   -          In Saint Lucia, a vulnerability index was developed with the government and piloted in 2022. The index aims to inform response planning for shock-responsive social protection and overall social protection policy and system strengthening and is useful in helping the government to identify vulnerable people before a disaster strikes and is designed to enable social assistance to support households most vulnerable and impacted by weather-related hazards and other shocks, by informing response planning, assistance targeting and delivery, the development of operational guidance and overall systems strengthening. Trainings were also conducted in various areas of social protection, with the objective of strengthening existing government systems. For example, a data Visualization training was provided to staff of the Ministries of Equity, Health, Education, and the Central Statistical Office , focusing on principles of data collection, data cleaning and preparation and introduction to Power BI. A total of 13 officers were trained in to better analyze and visualize raw data and to present it in easily understandable graphical presentations.  The training was part of the Ministry of Equity‚Äôs efforts to strengthen competencies and capacity in data management techniques. Twenty-nine government officials received online training in shock-responsive social protection to enhance capacities to strengthen the social protection system through preparedness measure and build technical competencies in designing and implementing shock-responsive social protection programmes at the individual, household, and community levels. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, WFP has provided technical support and guidance to the government in the targeting, verification, and consolidation of the beneficiary list for WFP cash assistance and the World Bank's 6-month cash program. WFP has engaged with the Ministry of National Mobilization in discussions to identify gaps in previous programs, resulting in a technical agreement to strengthen the system to reduce poverty and vulnerability, increase resilience, and provide assistance to those affected by the shock that will be signed in 2023. Through the Joint Programme, signed in April 2022, WFP and FAO will draw on the power of data, information systems and sectoral linkages to mitigate the impacts of climate change and related shocks at the household, community and national levels, promote and protect food security, livelihoods and strengthen resilience in a gender-responsive manner.  Lessons Learned:¬∑  The vulnerability index in Saint Lucia has the potential to strengthen inter-institutional collaboration and coordination and offers a lot of potential for making social assistance transfers or other development interventions more efficient, effective, and impactful. There is the possibility to explore the application of the vulnerability index in the context of socio-economic shocks beyond natural hazards and link it with livelihood analysis. Strengthening partnerships with ministries by establishing data linkages and sharing arrangements, especially for social assistance registries, household surveys and spatial information, and consider centralizing datasets where possible is key.",2636580.0,1994803.46,1466581.6,"Under strategic outcome 1 of its 2022-2026 Multi-Country Strategic Plan, WFP provides capacity strengthening support to national governments and institutions to strengthen disaster management and social protection systems to ensure that the immediate essential needs of the vulnerable can be met in times of crisis. WFP Caribbean‚Äôs work on social protection capacity strengthening includes regional learning, knowledge exchanges and training efforts and in 2023, WFP continued to administer trainings in different areas of social protection with the aim of improving the shock responsiveness of national systems. Trainings were conducted in following countries:  In support of national efforts to strengthen social protection, including in response to shocks, WFP in collaboration with UNICEF, conducted training in shock responsive social protection in Anguilla.  A total of 24 participants (18 females and 6 males) were trained at the 3.5-day event from organizations including the Ministry of Social Development (Department of Social Development; Gender Affairs Unit); Department of Labour; Anguilla Social Security Board; Department of Disaster Management; Anguilla Fire  Rescue; Ministry of Finance; Department of Information Technology and E-Government Services (DITES); Health Authority of Anguilla (HAA); Anguilla Red Cross. At the request of the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis, WFP and UNCEF jointly facilitated a training in shock responsive social protection, which brought together.  28 individuals (25 females and 3 males) from the Ministry of Social Development and Gender Affairs; the Nevis Island Administration (NIA); the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Nevis Disaster Management Department (NDMD).. To complement ongoing support to the Government of the Virgin Islands (UK) to improve national social protection systems, WFP trained 33 (29 females and 4 males) social protection and disaster management professionals.. The workshop focused on how the current system could be more responsive and helped to facilitate coordination among social protection, disaster management and other entities.  In order to expand the usage of a digital form, jointly developed by MPEA and the Government of Barbados, WFP was invited to  train an additional 34 (27 females and 7 males) social workers at the Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs (MPEA) on how to use the KoboCollect app to conduct the MPEA Emergency Relief/Socio-Economic Assessment. The digital form was jointly developed by WFP and the MPEA in 2022. In March, WFP also improved the ministry‚Äôs ability to conducted post distribution monitoring by training 2 MPEA staff. To meet data interpretation, data analysis and to improve understanding of statistics concepts in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, WFP partnered with the Ministry of National Mobilisation to provide Data Essentials Training to 21 (15 males and 6 females) staff.  Further, as part of the Joint SDG Fund project with FAO, WFP also helped to inprove knowledge and skills in shock responsive social protection to 26 individuals, including 20 females and 6 males government staff from the Ministry of National Mobilisation (et al), National Emergency Management Organization, Ministry of Health, Wellness and the Environment and the Ministry of Education and National Reconciliation participated in the training.  In May , as part of an SDG Joint programme, WFP, UNICEF and ILO brought permanent secretaries and other technical persons from social protection ministries to discuss strategies, best practices, challenges and solutions for developing national information management sessions.

In response to the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022 WFP provided cash assistance valued at US$ 50,260 to 593 individuals (of which 346 were women) as part of the national response to COVID-19 in Barbados . 12,084 food hampers were also distributed to vulnerable people (6,632 women) impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising cost of living in Barbados in December 2022. The beneficiaries were identified and verified using a rapid assessment form which was developed by the MPEA.In Saint Lucia, WFP supported cash-based transfer assistance to a total of 654 beneficiaries (310 males, 341 females) affected by Hurricane Elsa to support the recovery of households affected. The cash transfers were part of the broader pilot on shock-responsive social protection which also tested the household vulnerability index as well a digital payment mechanism. The cash transfers complemented the support provided for the temporary expansion of the Public Assistance Programme as part of the Government‚Äôs broader pandemic response strategy.In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, WFP continued to support people affected by the volcano eruption in 2021 providing cash, vouchers and school feeding. In 2022, cash assistance was provided to individuals, supporting 18,044 people. Around 1,308 people who were already facing financial challenges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic received value vouchers redeemable at a local supermarket chain, which helped them in meeting their essential needs. Additionally, WFP also worked with the Ministry of Education and National Reconciliation to financially support a school meals programme assisting 669 students identified as eligible through the government school feeding platform.WFP supported the expansion of the Public Assistance Programme also in Dominica, increasing the value of transfers made to existing beneficiaries and enabling the programme to identify and temporarily incorporate new households, for which digital registration was introduced. In total, 5,235 people received cash assistance to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2023, WFP continued to provide food assistance in Barbados in partnership with the Ministry of People Empowerment and Elder Affairs (MPEA) to households at risk of food insecurity due to the impact of COVID-19 and the rising cost of living.  A total of 10,128 individuals (5,804 females and 4,324 males) received food kits in January. The beneficiaries were identified and verified using a rapid assessment form which was developed by the (MPEA). The distribution of food kits was implemented through cross-agency collaboration among the MPEA, the Barbados Defense Force, the Department of Emergency Management and the Barbados Association of Professional Social Workers (BAPSW), with cross-cutting technical support from WFP. The distribution was monitored and tracked through a digital data collection software used by the field teams in the communities.  Additionally, WFP and the government of Dominica partnered to provide financial assistance to impacted households as part of a shock responsive social protection approach to mitigate the socio-economic impacts caused by a trough system that affected the country in 2022.  A total of 1,333 (651 females and 682 males) people received assistance under the cash transfer programme which was instrumental in helping beneficiaries cushion the impacts on disruptions to their livelihood activities and meeting their food and other essential needs. 637 households in 5 communities were identified by the Ministry of Health, Wellness and Social Services to receive the cash assistance depending on the family size, households with a total of 1-2 members received XCD 400 or XCD 750 for 3 or more members.  Lessons learned:  Dominica  Strengthening data management tools is essential to ensure efficient and effective assistance.   A comprehensive re-evaluation of cash assistance bands is crucial to ensure that they align with the evolving cost of basic needs. In-depth assessment of living expenses, considering factors like inflation and regional variations is recommended. Major government changes like elections can impact and delay responses through government social protection systems especially if there is a reshuffling of ministries, as responsibilities and counterparts can change. WFP had been working closely with civil servants and technical persons at different levels.

Social protection and disaster management systems were strengthened to provide assistance in times of crisis through the digitalization of data collection processes, data visualization, and the use of digital payments.Key Focus Areas for 2023Strengthen analytical processes/capacities informed by a consultative process with key stakeholders, to enable more effective response to shocks and disasters.Support the Ministry of Human Development with model for a scalable and shock-responsive social protection program that can mobilize assistance to vulnerable populations to increase their resilience to shocks.Main results:WFP‚Äôs work on capacity strengthening provides support to regional and national institutions to strengthen social protection systems to respond to shock ensuring that the immediate essential needs of the vulnerable can be met in times of crisis. In 2022, WFP carried out activities to enhance social protection systems at the national level to increase the internal technical/operational capacity of the Government to plan and implement shock-responsive social protection programmes and systems in Belize to respond to shocks through the following: -         In partnership with the Ministry of Human Development, Families, and Indigenous Affairs (MHDFIPA), WFP provided technical and advisory support to enhance the operational plan for the Relief and Supplies Management Committee (RSMC) of the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) to include various modalities of assistance (including cash), targeting criteria, instrument for data collection, monitoring, determination of the amount assistance for relief to support food and other essential needs and grievance redress. The RSMC‚Äôs updated operational plan was endorsed by NEMO prior to Hurricane Lisa in November and was tested during the hurricane response in 2022. -         WFP Caribbean‚Äôs work on capacity strengthening also included regional learning, knowledge exchanges and training efforts and in 2022, WFP administered a face-to face shock-responsive social protection training in Belize, with the aim of enhancing participants understanding of social protection, disaster risk management, and how preparation, response and mitigation of impacts from shocks are linked. A total of 26 participants were trained from the Belize National Emergency Management Organization and the Ministry of Human Development. In October 2022, focus group discussions were facilitated by WFP with specific vulnerable groups in Belize, namely, Indigenous communities (Maya and Garifuna), farmers (in Toledo and Stann Creek Districts), and representatives of people with disabilities. Around 40 individuals participated in the focus group discussions which aimed to gather impacts of the ongoing food and energy crises to livelihoods, spending on food and other essential needs, and overall well-being of these specific vulnerable groups that were not captured in the Food Security and Livelihoods Round Survey administered by WFP and CARICOM in August 2022. Highlights of the focus group discussions will be documented in the Special Focus of the Belize Country Report, which is expected to be finalized in December 2022. -         Additionally, WFP provided advisory and technical support in building a long-term partnership between the Government, the Ministry of Human Development, Families and Indigenous Peoples' Affairs (MHDFIPA) and a local financial service provider to establish a digital payment system within the Government which can be immediately mobilized in response to future shocks/crises. While previous digital payment solutions have been used in the English-speaking Caribbean the use of digital payments provides greater options for utilizing assistance and can help promote financial inclusion and economic empowerment of the most vulnerable and give people payment options for a more tailored and improved payment experience.Lessons learned:-  Coordination systems within the Government‚Äôs structure could be further improved. As such, UN agencies should play a more significant role in working collaboratively to improve coordination, minimize duplications and maximize and sustain investments. - Adequacy of assistance to families affected by shocks and emergencies needs to be assessed periodically to examine how effectively the essential needs of those affected are being met.- Simulation exercises should be done annually prior to the start of foreseen perennial shocks (such as hurricanes, excessive flooding during the rainy season) to test if plans, systems, and resources are adequate to respond to foreseen needs.",534791.0,429261.38,308437.42,"Main results:WFP‚Äôs work on capacity strengthening provides support to regional and national institutions to strengthen social protection systems to respond to shocks ensuring that the immediate essential needs of the vulnerable can be met in times of disasters and crisis. In 2023, WFP carried out activities to enhance social protection systems at the national level to increase the internal technical/operational capacity of the Government to plan and implement shock-responsive social protection programmes and systems in Belize through the following: ¬∑      Parallel to providing cash assistance under the Hurricane Lisa cash assistance Programmes, WFP partnered with the government to strengthen verification, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms for cash assistance through the use of digital tools to improve social assistance delivery. Eleven staff members (4 females and 7 males) from the Ministry of Human Development, Family and Indigenous People Affairs (MHDFIPA) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Enterprise (MAFSE) benefitted from trainings to design digital tools that capture vulnerability data to facilitate verification of potential beneficiaries under the national social protection systems. Support through training was also provided for post-distribution monitoring for the same staff of MHDFIPA and MAFSE, enabling the government to cascade the training to 20 local enumerators (11 females and 9 males). This support was aimed at further strengthening the Government's existing capacities in shock response to ensure the needs of the vulnerable can be met in a timely and effective manner.  ¬∑      WFP has a strong commitment to documenting the journey of building resilience through its approach to capacity strengthening and innovation. This component is important for opportunities for knowledge exchange, to influence national and regional policies and, more importantly, to continue to find solutions for increased resilience to compound shocks. In 2022 with the support of WFP the MHDFIPA updated its National Relief  Supplies Management Plan (RSMP) to guide the delivery of its mandate to ensure that adequate food, psychosocial services, and other relief assistance are available to affected populations in times of disasters. The RSMP was put to the test in 2022 with the events of excessive flooding and hurricane. In May 2023, WFP facilitated a Lessons Learned workshop on the 2022 Relief and Supplies Management Plan (RSMP) of the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) to assist the MHDFIPA to strengthen the shock-responsiveness of the RSMP by consolidating lessons and recommendations from key actors. Approximately 33 staff from MHDFIPA and NEMO Secretariat participated in the workshop. WFP and the MHDFIPA jointly produced a Lessons Learned Workshop Report which served as an internal document of the RSMC of Belize‚Äôs NEMO. The discussions and recommendations in the report represent solely the views of the Government participants and will be considered in updating the RSMP. ¬∑      WFP assisted the government to update the shock-responsive social protection Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to define processes and actions for preparedness and details on registration, targeting and delivery mechanisms for disaster response based on lessons learned from the Hurricane Lisa response. ¬∑      Support to monitoring systems, payments systems, standard operational procedures, digital tools, design of cash-based transfers (targeting, transfer values, etc), and shock-responsiveness of all these measures form part of WFP‚Äôs overall support to developing Belize‚Äôs social protection system and strategy. Since 2022, WFP together with other UN agencies have been continuously consulting with local stakeholders to assist the Government in formulating its National Social Protection Framework, which culminated in a Social Protection Summit in October 2023. A draft of the SP Framework is expected by mid-2024.   Lessons learned: (1)   Government ownership of systems and processes is important to a successful program implementation and in demonstrating good practices for wider Government adoption.  (2)   Small and carefully designed pilot programs allow the Government to try innovative approaches within a more controlled low-risk environment. WFP should more proactively explore financing support for these types of pilots that can have significant demonstration effects.  (3)   Documentation of experiences through PDMs of 2 pilot programs (HLAP with MHDFIPA and HL-RAP with MAFSE) on the use of cash for relief assistance and digital solutions as a delivery mechanism provided sufficient evidence for NEMO to formally adopt these approaches as part of their Relief and Supplies Management Plan (RSMP) for 2023 onwards.

In partnership with the Office of the Prime Minister (Gender and Child Affairs), WFP provided technical guidance for the composition of a food basket based on the WFP NutVal tool for Gender based violence victims. The food basket is tailored to local preferences, demographic profile, activity levels, climatic conditions and local coping capacity ensuring the government can effectively meet the nutritional requirements of targeted populations under social programmes providing food assistance.  Additionally, WFP collaborated with the National School Dietary Services Limited to improve efficiency and resource management in designing school menus for nutrition programmes in Trinidad and Tobago. During the year WFP provided trainings to three nutritionists (all females) based at the National School Meals Dietary on the AI-driven School Menu Planning (SMP) tool which is a software that allows users to save time and resources in designing school menus that are tailored to local context and nutritional needs. Following the training, WFP made this innovative tool available to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. Partnering with the Ministry of Youth Development and National Service (MYDNS), WFP engaged in the promotion of activities aimed at attracting youth in agriculture. Given that the MYDNS launched a number of Youth in Agriculture programmes, WFP closely interacted with the coordinators of these programmes and supported Youth Caravan campaigns. Within the framework on National Disaster Prevention and Preparedness month that is marked in May in Trinidad and Tobago, WFP together with the Institute of Inter-American Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA) conducted a workshop for farmers on disaster preparedness. Almost 40 farmers received training on the best practices and tools that could help in saving crops from the losses caused by disasters. WFP also joined IICA in initiating the development partner forum on food security and agriculture during the year. The first meeting brought together participants from the Ministry of Agriculture, private sector, academia, international and regional organisations and looked at the options for Trinidad and Tobago in the context of 25 by 25 initiative, i.e. reducing food imports by 25 percent by the year 2025. As a result, currently the work is ongoing on the draft of food production plan put together by the Ministry of Agriculture.Upon the invitation from the Ministry of Health, WFP became a member of the Project Steering Committee on the Food Consumption and Nutrition Survey. WFP presented its methodology in conducting food security assessments and advised government officials on the most appropriate indicators and tools that could be used in Trinidad and Tobago. Based on this engagement, the Ministry of Health is considering incorporating WFP-suggested methodology in the Food Consumption Survey that is planned for 2024.In May 2023, WFP administered the sixth round of the food security and livelihoods survey on behalf of CARICOM. The survey results revealed that 3.7 million out of 7.1 million people, or 52 percent of the population of the English-speaking Caribbean, remain food insecure. While this is a 10 percent decrease when compared to an August 2022 survey, the results highlighted growing financial hardship and challenges due to the rising cost of living in the aftermath of the pandemic. The surveys continue to play a critical role in informing analysis and decision-making for governments and development partners in the region and have significantly contributed to the current prioritization of the food security agenda. In August 2023, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for Trinidad and Tobago allowing the government to get a snapshot of the situation in the country. According to the report, people continue to experience challenges to their livelihoods due to the current cost of living crisis. Most respondents to the survey reported significant price increases in food, housing, gas, health and fuels and food consumption patterns show challenges with food security in the country. https://www.wfp.org/publications/caribbean-food-security-livelihoods-survey-may-2023  ",194251.5,150863.48,118619.68,-,194251.5,161706.46,137324.19,-,,,,-,,,,-

During the last mission of the international agronomist of ASTA, Mr. Freddy Gamboa, in Suriname a workshop was conducted for government officials. The aim of the workshop was to train government officials on GAP used in pineapple production in the Caribbean and northern and southern America. In total 24 people participated in the workshop, from which 14 females.The project team, in partnership with FairFood International, an international NGO, and Tradin Organic, an exporting company, endeavored to cooperate in the development of a traceability platform and submitted a joint grant application to the RVO, the Government of the Netherlands, but unfortunately, proposal did not make it through the selection process for this year. Nevertheless, this setback has forged a strong partnership that holds promise for fruitful collaboration in 2024, as ASTA team will continue these partnerships to work towards the development and implementation of a platform designed to trace production and delivery for buyers.",164942.0,132445.32,88921.15," In 2024, the project established a multi-stakeholder foundation named the Horticulture Innovation HUB, designed to provide long-term support to agricultural producers. A total of 140 farmers, from which approx. 70% women in ITP communities received training on improved pineapple production models, showcasing their economic benefits. In advancing SDG 5, the project provided Gender Capacity Building training to 174 farmers, including both male and female participants. Farmers were trained in leadership inclusion, decision-making, conflict resolution, business skills, and gender equity. A digital platform was developed in collaboration with Dimitra, a global agriculture tech company, to connect pineapple farmers in Moengo, Marowijne, and the four indigenous communities in Para.

Utilising Western Union's extensive network of 235 locations, WFP delivered direct financial assistance to 3,489 households that consisted of 10,857 individuals (5,487 women and 5,370 men) with overall transfer value of USD 1.2 million.Priority was given to households that met a specified criteria calculated through a vulnerability score based on data captured in the JHDINA, and further verified during a follow-up phase. WFP prioritised assistance to individuals experiencing near-total (Level 3 damage) or total (Level 4 damage) destruction of their homes, with beneficiaries with a less severe damage (Level 2) considered for assistance based on additional vulnerability criteria, such as the presence of children, elderly individuals, or persons with disabilities within the household.Transfer values were determined according to household size:- Households with 1-2 persons will receive JMD 20,000 (US$ 128).- Households with 3-5 persons will receive JMD 36,000 (US$ 230).- Households with 6 or more persons will receive JMD 50,000 (US$ 320).Beneficiaries were informed of their assistance through mobile messaging, showcasing WFP‚Äôs commitment to leveraging technology for improved communication and transparency. Various additional communication methods, including sealed envelopes and outbound calls were utilised, highlighting WFP‚Äôs dedication to reaching the intended beneficiaries through all available channels. The project also created a strong Community Feedback Mechanism that allowed beneficiaries to share feedback, access timely support, report any issue or seek information about the assistance programme.The first round of cash disbursements, which started on September 12 and concluded on October 18, 2024, targeted 3,415 beneficiary households. By the end of the round, 3,156 households redeemed their assistance, achieving a 93% redemption rate. A total of JMD 93,350,000 (USD 685,197) was disbursed during this phase.The second round, which started on October 28, 2024 and concluded on January 18, 2025, expanded the caseload to 3,489 households, including the incorporation of 333 newly eligible households identified through additional assessments. A total of 3,418 households redeemed their assistance, reaching an redemption rate of 98%. Disbursements for this round totalled JMD 119,530,000 (USD 767,292.58).Promoting Accountability Through a Community Feedback MechanismIn parallel with the cash transfer programme, WFP established a Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM) to foster accountability and transparency. This system enables beneficiaries to provide feedback, raise concerns, ask for data information change, seek support and offer suggestions, aligning with global Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) standards. The CFM infrastructure included transferring tablets to the Jamaica Office, purchasing SIM cards for calls, creating a dedicated email line, and employing four monitoring assistants to manage a helpline at the UN Common Premises. Throughout the programme‚Äôs implementation, WFP worked closely with the MLSS teams at parish level to ensure that all efforts were made and maximized to reach beneficiaries for delivery of cash assistance.During the first payment period, the CFM hotline handled nearly 3,450 calls, comprising over 1,585 inbound calls and more than 1,865 outbound calls.

Emergency response equipment kits have been pre-positioned in Barbados as one of the four CDEMA sub-regional focal point countries, while equipment has also been donated to three countries recently affected by disasters (Bahamas; Dominica; and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). These assets help to strengthen the response capabilities of CDEMA and include mobile storage units, prefabricated offices, as well as associated equipment such as generators. In 2022, WFP continued to partner with CDEMA to ensure the readiness of disaster management agencies to use emergency response assets in an emergency. Together, CDEMA and WFP facilitated a series of four-day Emergency Response Equipment Workshops for disaster management offices on the use and deployment of the emergency response equipment pre-positioned in the region. This continuation of emergency response equipment training is intended to support hurricane preparedness and is in support of both the CDEMA Logistics Programme and regional preparedness strategies.   In mid-2022, WFP signed of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Barbados and subsequently launched the Regional Logistics Hub and Centre of Excellence. This facility will act as an emergency logistics hub for emergency preparedness and response efforts in the English and Dutch-Speaking Caribbean. Procurement for the civil works is underway and the prefabricated steel structure for the warehouse is already procured and on site in Barbados. It is expected that the first phase to establish the operational hub will be completed in 2023. Lessons Learned:¬∑      In addition to providing emergency response trainings workshops and trainings, annual refresher sessions are needed  to ensure continuous support towards strengthening national emergency capacity response",3901931.0,2726104.13,2080452.73,"In preparation for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, WFP and the the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) conducted trainings in emergency humanitarian logistics in  Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis A total of 25 (6 females and 19 males) and 31 (15 females and 16 males) persons were trained in Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Kitts and Nevis respectively.   Antigua and Barbuda benefited from role-based scenario exercises that allowed participation to better apply knowledge to the national context. This has led to a move toward incorporating this approach in future training sessions on emergency logistics.  In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, staff from the National Emergency Management Organization along with emergency response personnel that make up the Emergency Operation Centre benefited from training in the use and deployment of donated emergency response assets in preparation for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. A total of 30 (8 females and 22 males) participants were trained.  As an integral part of the adoption of the CDEMA Logistics System (CLS) by countries, WFP and CDEMA to provide tailored support through training and technical assistance to integrate the system into their national disaster management framework. The CLS is a platform that allows national, regional, and international humanitarian actors to register and track logistics, food, and other assets that CDEMA can call on in an emergency.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica, through the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) has advanced in the integration of CLS, supported by WFP and CDEMA to improve data management practices, and develop standard operating procedures for warehousing and logistics.  Under the Technical Agreement with the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines National Emergency Management Office (NEMO), WFP is funding a Logistics Assistant and a Programme Coordinator positions both of whom are supporting NEMO with various preparedness activities/initiatives. The Logistics Assistant has been a key player in supporting NEMO with warehouse inventory and compilation of damage assessment data by census district for impacts from various hazards. e.g., Tropical Storm Bret. The Programme Coordinator facilitated the NEMO Summer School Programme and supported coordination and development of proposals for various events organized by NEMO. WFP is also supporting data collection, analysis and the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Warehousing and inventory management that will contribute to the Logistics and Supply Chain program.   Work to establish the Caribbean Regional Logistics Hub and Centre of Excellence in Barbados continued in 2023.  Phase 1 of the hub is complete and the second phase to establish the warehousing facility has commenced with a completion date of June 2024. The facility will act as an emergency logistics hub for emergency preparedness and response efforts in the English and Dutch-Speaking Caribbean.  Lessons learned: For the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Emergency Response Equipment Training, the assessment of equipment conditions across countries demands adequate time, with careful attention from host organizations to secure equipment and minimize damage. It was also recommended that Manuals should be enhanced for easier navigation, including adding lists of parts/equipment names and quantities (Prefab Office) and conversion sheets showing centimeters and feet (MSU). Saint Vincent and the Grenadines CLS training: Having Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and conducting a 100% stock take is crucial because they signify a shift from reactive approaches to proactive planning. This change serves as a bridge towards adopting systems thinking, a transition that is effectively supported by digital platforms like CLS. CLS Rollout workshops should involve only core warehouse/logistics operations staff, who will later disseminate processes and training to other end users. Cadet forces specialists should be actively and transparently engaged in SOP development and ongoing training as much as possible. SOP workshops should be run separately in advance of these trainings. WFP places significant emphasis on regional partnerships in alignment with Caribbean countries' commitment to regional integration and collaboration. As such, country's financial requirements and funding availability reflect also regional contributions implemented by WFP through its partnerships with regional institutions including CDEMA, CARICOM and/or OECS among others.",3503165.0,2551231.57,1973326.3,-,3503165.0,2922771.33,2220707.77,-,,,,-,,,,-

In the first of its kind in Belize, WFP and the government worked with the private sector to use a mobile wallet to deliver immediate relief support in the form of cash to families heavily affected by Hurricane Lisa and tailor this digital solution to additionally enable the use of a mobile voucher (or restricted cash) to support livelihood recovery of small farmers who sustained losses from the hurricane. Although cash and digital payment solutions are already used in the English-speaking Caribbean, this was the first case of the Government using cash for relief assistance and of using a digital payment solution as a mechanism to deliver assistance in the aftermath of a sudden-onset emergency. The use of this digital payment solution immensely increased the government‚Äôs efficiency and cost-effectiveness in delivering social assistance to meet the immediate nutritional and other essential needs of vulnerable people. As a result, NEMO adopted both the use of cash and digital payment solutions for its disaster relief assistance as reflected in the Relief and Supplies Management Plan of 2023. More broadly, in 2023, WFP embarked on a Digital Payment Ecosystem study with the Ministry of Public Utilities, Logistics, and E-governance (MPUELE) who leads the digitalization agenda in Belize to comprehensively review the experiences in the use of digital payment platforms in the country. A User Journey workshop, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a digital readiness survey were undertaken with various local partners and programme beneficiaries to map out user experiences and ‚Äòpain points‚Äô with regard to receiving social protection payments, find solutions to issues uncovered, and identify opportunities for partnerships and collaboration as part of a broader effort to explore digital payments for social protection. The study intends to provide Government with meaningful analysis to inform and further support the scale up of the use of digital payment solutions as a viable instrument to deliver government assistance and services both in regular times and in times of crises/disasters with increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Lessons learned:(1)	Preliminary findings from the Digital Payment Ecosystem study as well as actual experience from the implementation of Hurricane Lisa cash assistance programs (HLAP with MHDFIPA and HL-RAP with MAFSE) demonstrate interest from the private sector in testing out innovative solutions to address clients‚Äô needs and in partnering with Government (as a major client) to deliver better and faster services to the public, including vulnerable populations. Government of Belize should capitalize on these partnerships to continue improving the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in delivering services, especially social assistance in times of crises and disasters. (2)	Service providers will also minimize the costs of accessing these services to program beneficiaries. Government can explore ways of partnering with the private sector to address this (e.g., through an incentive system). ",87500.0,72358.34,62160.11,-,87500.0,75492.22,65135.07,-,,,,-,,,,-

A total of five rounds of the survey were administered and the final report consolidates data gathered in August 2022, and includes previous rounds of data released in April 2020, June 2020, February 2021 and February 2022 for the purpose of comparison. This edition of the report also included an analysis of cost-of-living impacts including a special focus on farming and fishing livelihoods. One regional summary report along with an updated interactive dashboard was produced. One report was also drafted for Belize and will be published in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, in October 2022, WFP also facilitated focus group discussions with specific vulnerable groups in Belize, namely, Indigenous communities (Maya and Garifuna), farmers (in Toledo and Stann Creek Districts), and representatives of people with disabilities. A total of 40 individuals participated in the focus group discussions which were intended to gather information on the impacts of the ongoing food and energy crises on livelihoods, spending on food and other essential needs, and the overall well-being of these specific vulnerable groups that were not captured in the survey. Highlights will be documented in the Special Focus of the Belize Country Report, which is expected to be finalized in December 2022.",86329.0,74263.09,48838.54,"Main results:In May 2023, WFP administered the sixth round of the food security and livelihoods survey on behalf of CARICOM. The survey results revealed that 3.7 million out of 7.1 million people, or 52 percent of the population of the English-speaking Caribbean, remain food insecure. While this is a 10 percent decrease when compared to an August 2022 survey, the results highlighted growing financial hardship and challenges due to the rising cost of living in the aftermath of the pandemic. The surveys continue to play a critical role in informing analysis and decision-making for governments and development partners in the region and have significantly contributed to the current prioritization of the food security agenda. In August 2023, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for Belize. According to the report, people continue to experience challenges to their livelihoods due to the current cost of living crisis. Most respondents to the survey reported significant price increases in food, housing, gas, health and fuels and food consumption patterns show challenges with food security in the country. https://www.wfp.org/publications/caribbean-food-security-livelihoods-survey-may-2023  In partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security  Enterprise (MAFSE) and the Statistical Institute of Belize (SIB), WFP provided technical support to map the market monitoring processes towards harmonizing efforts to establish a single best-in class system for the country. Such a system should provide timely market information across entire value chains for critical agri-food commodities, from farm to fork, and disseminated at a global scale. This information is important for several reasons including early warning and forecasting, policy tools such as price controls and subsidies that are implementable by the government, attracting foreign and domestic investment, measuring current economic patterns and impact of current policies, and calibrating subsidies and assistance programs for vulnerable populations. In 2023, WFP also initiated its support to MAFSE in developing its National Food Systems Transformation Pathway, which now includes levers on strengthening value chains for local production, expansion of the national school feeding program, and building resilience supported by early warning systems. The policy was presented at the UN Food Systems Summit +2 Stocktaking Moment in Rome in July 2023. Preparation of a multi-ministerial implementation plan of the policy is ongoing with technical assistance form WFP.Lessons learned:(1)   Critical to the progress and success of the policy is continued technical and financial support from relevant UN agencies (FAO, WFP, and IFAD) given current weak Government capacity to move this agenda forward.

The research on the Mapping of Food Security and Nutrition (MapaSAN) was finalized in May 2022, and its data were treated and statistically analyzed so that they can be made available to states and municipalities. The project also made efforts to carry out a diagnosis on the linkages between food banks, donor partners and beneficiary institutions, as well as mapping, characterization and organization of data related to Public Food Security and Nutrition Equipment - EPSANs in Brazil, in addition to the preparation of a Manual for the Implementation of Food Banks. Regarding the Brazilian Food Network, the focus was on improving the services, with actions aimed at the elaboration of the proposal for a Management and Operations Manual for Family Farming Centers, as well as technical subsidies on tax benefits within the scope of food donation programs. Urban and peri-urban agriculture actions were also highlighted by the project, including the Pedagogical School Gardens, with the objective of contributing to the realization of the human right to adequate food and improving food conditions in the school environment. In this sense, the online course 'Management of Pedagogical School Gardens' aimed at teachers is being developed by UTF/BRA/085/BRA, as well as the development of strategies to promote healthy food at school. The project also continued the improvement of policies that expand access to healthy food by the public most vulnerable to hunger. Thus, a study was carried out to update the Intersectoral Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Obesity. In addition, the cooperation between FAO and MDS has supported the implementation of the Intersectoral Strategy for the Reduction of Food Losses and Waste in Brazil, through the formulation of recommendations for its improvement. ",221820.0,175219.0,127321.69,"The project was implemented from December 2013 to June 2024 and was relevant to strengthening the government's technical capabilities, by accelerating and scaling up the implementation of strategic actions for the qualification and expansion of Food Security and Nutrition (FSN) programs and consolidation of the decentralization of the National System for Food Security and Nutrition (SISAN). The project evaluation highlighted the following main achievements: It was possible to guide and encourage the adhesion of states, the Federal District and municipalities to the SISAN, in addition to obtaining progress on the part of the states in the preparation of their FSN plans. Nowadays, all federation units and some municipalities have already joined the system. Through the project, it was possible to implement the FSN Mapping (MapaSAN), a tool that strengthens the monitoring and evaluation of public policies, which consists of identifying and surveying the situation of FSN actions in the states, the Federal District and municipalities to obtain an overview of the policy implementation. The identification of territories in Food and Nutrition Insecurity, the so-called food deserts, was developed through the Mapping of Food and Nutrition Insecurity, targeting people in social vulnerability. These results allowed us to qualify and focus on public policies related to food supply in the country, including the network of public FSN facilities (community kitchens, popular restaurants, food banks or family farming centers). The project supported the management of Food Banks and the structuring of the Brazilian Network of Food Banks. Materials were prepared on food donation in the country, and for guiding actions to rescue quality food suitable for human consumption. Technological initiatives, studies and partnerships with high potential for contribution to the theme were also systematized. Regarding actions aimed at early childhood, within the scope of the project, visit protocols were developed, with an approach to FSN and food education, with the objective of applying it to the Happy Child Program aiming at the identification of the situation of Food and Nutrition Insecurity (INSAN), involving the training of approximately 25 thousand visitors of the program. Traditional peoples and communities (indigenous peoples, quilombola and artisanal fishermen, extractive peoples) were also supported, through guidance and improvement of rural productive inclusion actions specific to this public.

In 2022, WFP continued to engage in workshops, trainings and knowledge transfer on shock-responsive social protection in Jamacia in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) with the aim to enhance national social protection systems to increase their capacity to provide assistance to shock-affected people. Trainings on the Jamaica Household Disaster Impact Assessment Tool for social workers (41 participants), and a 3-day data preparedness training were held for units within MLSS on data collection, analysis, and visualization to support the digital deployment of the Jamaica Household Disaster Impact Assessment Tool. Eleven (11) persons participated in the training which was aimed at supporting post-disaster household assessments to help inform for post-disaster social protection mechanisms. Of note, MLSS has taken on board the training provided on data collection utilizing the electronic version of the JHDINA data collection tool and work has begun for the Ministry to integrate the utilization of the electronic form and supporting technologies as part of its business processes.   Fourteen (14) persons from Ministry of Labour and Social Security and Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) benefited from a two-part webinar on shock responsive social protection. Seven females and two males represented MLSS and five females represented ODPEM. The webinar used scenario-based learning to equip the participants with knowledge on how to strengthen social protection systems through preparedness measures. This will in turn improve technical competencies to design and implement shock-responsive social protection programmes to support people impacted by the shocks and disasters.   In Jamaica, WFP has continued to work with the Government of Jamaica to pursue new payment modalities by testing digital payments to improve service delivery and reduce transaction costs of cash assistance. The use of digital payments can help promote financial inclusion and economic empowerment of the most vulnerable and provide people payment options for a more tailored and improved payment experience. As part of its earlier cash assistance programme, WFP and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security put in place a tailored dashboard to enable tracking and support follow-up and reporting. In November, WFP administered a digital readiness survey targeting retailers and vendors in Jamaica to assess their readiness and capacity to facilitate digital payments to beneficiaries. By collating data from more than five hundred vendors and retailers across Jamaica, the survey findings will be utilized to inform government strategies as part of efforts to widen adoption of digital technologies for social assistance payments moving forward. WFP has used a user-centred approach to identify needs to help facilitate future payments pilots or payment scale ups by developing user centred-recommendations for future programming. The agency has identified existing gender disparities and inequities in terms of service availability, access and use, to inform solutions that are responsive to women‚Äôs differential backgrounds, needs and lifestages through focus group discussions and key informant interviews that took place in 2022. The research to date has been crucial for advocacy with private sector providers and governments to take gender and other factors into consideration when shaping programmes and products to facilitate increased access and use of digital finance solutions Indeed, gender considerations identified through focus group discussions and key informant interviews will be factored into the design of the testing of new payment modalities in Jamaica.      WFP provides support within the region by leveraging its operational capacities to provide common services to government and humanitarian partners in coordination with CDEMA in the event of an emergency as needs are identified.   In 2022, WFP continued to advance supply chain management and emergency logistics at the regional and national levels, supporting CDEMA‚Äôs capacity to manage a well-coordinated, rapid, and efficient response. WFP supported CDEMA‚Äôs logistics capacities by embedding two logistics specialists in CDEMA and one logistics associate based in Jamaica at the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM). The secondee placed by WFP into ODPEM contributed to the development of draft document for National Logistics Plan and Policy and to a document that government Inventory Management procedures for ODPEM.

At the end of 2023, MLSS was in process of establishing a dedicated server to facilitate the management of data and information for beneficiary intake and registration for future interventions.  Building on previous assistance to test the use of digital payment modalities to deliver social assistance in 2022, in 2023, WFP continued to provide assistance to the government to conduct research on the country‚Äôs digital financial ecosystems, to identify challenges and further explore opportunities in the digital space. In August, findings from the research were launched during a half-day session convened by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) with participation from MLSS. The research provided the Government with analysis on the current state of the digital financial ecosystem with the view of exploring the use of digital payment modalities for improved social protection delivery and rapid scale-ups in emergencies. The findings from this research are also expected to help to shape a more gender-responsive approach to strengthening social protection in the country.  WFP Caribbean‚Äôs capacity strengthening programme includes regional learning, knowledge exchanges, and training efforts. In August, WFP conducted training on shock-responsive social protection in Jamacia. A total of 25 individuals were trained from the MLSS and the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM). Participants were trained in shock preparedness and response and benefitted from peer-to-peer exchange to foster innovative strategies for linking social protection to disaster risk management. Additionally, a Shock-Responsive Social Protection and Action Planning Workshop was convened with 25 participants from MLSS and ODPEM during a four-day session (14 to 17 August 2023) with the inclusion of a half-day action planning component, which will inform future technical assistance activities and priorities with government.   In addition, and as part of its work to test new digital payment modalities, WFP supported the MLSS with the training of 25 enumerators (16 females and 9 males) on data collection using the KoboCollect data collection application. Training took place in three parishes (Hanover, St Catherine and St Elizabeth) and was utilized as preparation for initial targeting and beneficiary registration among 1,618 individuals in three parishes. In follow-up to this phase of targeting, WFP provided additional training to 22 enumerators (15 females and 7 males) in November ahead of in-person interviews to be conducted by MLSS in late November and early December. These in-person interviews were conducted among XX households and will be utilized to inform targeting among most vulnerable individuals for a pilot initiative to test new digital payment modalities.

The survey results revealed that 3.7 million out of 7.1 million people, or 52 percent of the population of the English-speaking Caribbean, remain food insecure. While this is a 10 percent decrease when compared to an August 2022 survey, the results highlighted growing financial hardship and challenges due to the rising cost of living in the aftermath of the pandemic. The surveys continue to play a critical role in informing analysis and decision-making for governments and development partners in the region and have significantly contributed to the current prioritization of the food security agenda. Between August and October 2023, WFP published country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summaries for St Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua and Barbuda and Barbados. WFP provided technical support to map the market monitoring processes towards harmonizing efforts to establish a single best-in class system in countries such as  Barbados, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Such a system should provide timely market information across entire value chains for critical agri-food commodities, from farm to fork, and disseminated at a global scale. This information is important for several reasons including early warning and forecasting, policy tools such as price controls and subsidies that are implementable by the government, attracting foreign and domestic investment, measuring current economic patterns and impact of current policies, and calibrating subsidies and assistance programs for vulnerable populations.   In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines WFP supported the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Rural Transformation, Industry and Labour to digitise government‚Äôs programme of support to farmers. WFP helped to complete a mapping exercise that has led to the creation of a data collection tool and project mapping dashboard. Both tools will provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing projects and allows the Government to improve data management, identify cross-project dependencies, promote linkages with other sectors and establish effective coordination mechanisms. The dashboard‚Äôs use will facilitate evidence-based decision-making and overall contribute to achieving better outcomes in the agricultural sector. Also in development are Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to introduce a structured framework that streamlines processes, clarifies roles and responsibilities, and enhances data handling processes within the ministry to track project progression, improves financial oversight through enhanced transparency and accountability in budgeting and expenditure. This will, in turn, contribute to improving financial oversight through enhanced transparency and accountability in budgeting and expenditure.  the Ministry of National Mobilisation, Social development  Youth in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and WFP are working to improve livelihood opportunities for vulnerable people. Initial efforts focused on building knowledge and skills in agriculture, small business and financial management, tools, methods and skills, including how to increase their resilience to climate and other shocks to address the impact of disasters on livelihoods of small holder farmers and other vulnerable people. A total of 1,778 (874 females and 904 males) participants are confirmed to have been trained thus far.  WFP also facilitated and supported the Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica, to participate in ‚ÄòThe Power of Multi-Sector Approaches for Human Capital Development‚Äù event which was held in Brazil in August 202. The event aimed to chart out pathways to strengthen human capital in the region so that every person can reach their full potential. The Forum offered an opportunity for representatives from across the region to boost multi-sector approaches linking education, food security and nutrition for human capital development, using two complementary approaches: school feeding and social protection systems. The government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has since signed onto the School Meals Coalition . ",328498.5,236821.8,178761.35,-,328498.5,305985.97,281005.71,-,,,,-,,,,-

It covers issues of food production, supplies, transport and services, and assess their integration into disaster resilience governance arrangements, policies and projects. In Brazil, the tool was nationally piloted in Porto Alegre (RS) in November 2022, when UNDRR held a series of urban disaster resilience activities in the framework of the Making Resilient Cities 2030 (MCR2030) initiative, with the support of the Municipal Secretariat for Local Governance and Policy Coordination (SMGOV). Porto Alegre's commitment to MCR2030 is part of a wider process of strengthening the metropolitan governance of risks in Greater Porto Alegre, as well as becoming one of the first cities in Latin American to renew its Resilience Strategy (prepared in 2016 with the support of the former-100 Resilient Cities, now Global Network of Resilient Cities and partner of MCR2030). UNDRR's support aimed to accelerate the renewal of the Resilience Strategy with the holding of a two-days workshop to comprenhensively assess the resilience capabilities of Porto Alegre. The activity was attended by representatives of all municipal bodies that make up the Permanent Commission for Emergency Action (Copae), which collectively completed the UNDRR's Disaster Resilience Self-Assessment Tool for Cities (Scorecard), along with its Addenda on food systems and public health. After nearly 200 resilience indicators, participants assessed that the municipality had a solid capacity base for risk management and resilience, as shown in the many resilience actions already being implemented in Porto Alegre. Nonetheless, to use the Food System Addendum, together with its Public Health counterpart, helped Porto Alegre to pinpoint the need for the local government to scale up existing resilience actions, better reach out to all communities, and better integrate public health and food security considerations and actors into the local resilience agenda.The experience in Porto Alegre will serve to replicate the use of the Scorecard's Food System Addendum in Brazil and across the Americas and Caribbean.

WFP carried out a one-week scoping mission in Jamaica with the intent to assess the status of school feeding in the country, with an emphasis on key issues and gaps that the organization can help address. Specifically, the Government requested support in analyzing challenges including in programme design, logistics and procurement systems, digitalization, monitoring and accountability. WFP has developed a roadmap for technical assistance for government consideration as a follow up to the mission. WFP also facilitated and supported the Government of Jamaica's participation in the IX Latin America and Caribbean Regional School Feeding Forum in Colombia in April 2022. The Forum offered an opportunity for the Jamaican delegation - led by Honourable Minister Fayval Williams - to exchange information and best practices with countries across the region for the improvement of the national school feeding programme in Jamaica, and to further learn about several options to help with digitalizing certain aspects of school feeding design and implementation. In 2022, WFP in partnership with CARICOM undertook two rounds of data collection on the state of food security, livelihoods and access to markets related to COVID-19 and the global food price crisis within the region. The most recent data was collected in August 2022. Results from this survey provided insights into food security and disruption of livelihoods. The latest edition of the report included an analysis of cost-of-living impacts including a special focus on farming and fishing livelihoods. One regional summary report along with an updated interactive dashboard was produced. """,122093.0,104801.79,74427.48,"In May 2023, WFP administered the sixth round of the food security and livelihoods survey on behalf of CARICOM. The survey results revealed that 3.7 million out of 7.1 million people, or 52 percent of the population of the English-speaking Caribbean, remain food insecure. While this is a 10 percent decrease when compared to an August 2022 survey, the results highlighted growing financial hardship and challenges due to the rising cost of living, in the aftermath of the pandemic. The surveys continue to play a critical role in informing analysis and decision-making for governments and development partners in the region and have significantly contributed to the current prioritization of the food security agenda. In August 2023, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for Jamaica. According to the report, people continue to experience challenges to their livelihoods due to the current cost of living crisis. Most respondents to the survey reported significant price increases in food, housing, gas, health and fuels and food consumption patterns show challenges with food security in the country. https://www.wfp.org/publications/caribbean-food-security-livelihoods-survey-may-2023 .ÔªøGiven the Government of Jamaica‚Äôs interest in improving the delivery of the national school meals programme, WFP also facilitated the participation of the Government of Jamaica in ‚ÄòThe Power of Multi-Sector Approaches for Human Capital Development‚Äù event which was held in Brazil in August 2022. The event aimed to chart out pathways to strengthen human capital in the region so that every person can reach their full potential. The Forum offered an opportunity for representatives from across the region to boost multi-sector approaches linking education, food security and nutrition for human capital development via school feeding and social protection systems. ",79000.0,63973.45,50265.91,"Enhancing National School FeedingSchool Feeding Programmes remains a cornerstone of Jamaica‚Äôs efforts to combat food insecurity, particularly among vulnerable children. WFP continued to provide technical assistance to the Government of Jamaica to improve the delivery, quality, and coverage of this programme. This support aims to ensure that children across Jamaica have consistent access to nutritious meals, essential for their growth and academic success. A significant milestone in 2024 was the launch of a three-year Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Joint Programme for Digital Transformation in collaboration with UN partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF). Under this initiative, WFP is partnering with the Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth and Information to support efforts to modernise and digitise major components of the school feeding programme. This will include efforts to:1. Strengthen Data and Information Management: Enhanced data systems allow for real-time monitoring and evaluation of the programme‚Äôs reach and impact, ensuring accountability and identifying areas for improvement.2. Optimise Supply Chains: Assessing and streamlining supply chain operations may improve efficiency, reduce costs, and minimise waste, enabling more resources to be directed toward feeding children.3. Implement a Menu Creation Platform: A digital platform for designing cost-effective, nutritionally balanced school meal menus is to be introduced. This tool will empower schools to provide healthier meals that meet the dietary needs of students while maximising available resources.Data-Driven Insights for Food Security and LivelihoodsIn May, WFP launched the seventh round of the Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) survey. The survey provided critical insights into regional and national food security dynamics, highlighting both progress and persistent challenges.Key Analytical Insights from the FSL Survey from a Caribbean-wide perspective:1. Reduction in Food Insecurity: The survey reported a 17% decline in food insecurity levels compared to 2023, signaling that strategic interventions are beginning to yield results.2. Persistent Challenges: Despite these improvements, approximately three million individuals‚Äî78% more than pre-pandemic levels‚Äîcontinue to experience moderate to severe food insecurity, highlighting the lingering impact of systemic shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic.3. Vulnerability Hotspots: Low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and those with chronic illnesses remain disproportionately affected. Alarmingly, one-third of respondents reported low resilience to natural hazards, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in these communities.These findings present a nuanced understanding of the state of food systems in the Caribbean, enabling governments and partners to identify priority areas for intervention. To further enhance efforts at policymaking in food security and livelihoods, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for Jamaica. The results reveal that, while the percentage of respondents struggling with high livelihood-related costs decreased from 61% to 44% between May 2023 and April 2024, these costs remain a significant concern. Despite a slight decline in inflation during early 2024, 58% of respondents reported significant food price increases in the three months before the survey. This localised report provides the government with actionable data to develop context-specific strategies, bridging gaps in food security systems and addressing the unique vulnerabilities of each Jamaica.

The Guyana Ministry of Education, WFP and FAO conducted a scoping mission, including a desktop assessment to guide the work of the Ministry of Education in the development of a nutrition-sensitive, locally sourced menu for schools for the implementation of a homegrown school feeding programme. WFP also facilitated and supported the Government of Guyana to participate in ‚ÄòThe Power of Multi-Sector Approaches for Human Capital Development‚Äù event which was held in Brazil in August 2022. The forum aimed to chart out pathways to strengthen human capital in the region so that every person can reach their full potential. The event offered an opportunity for representatives from across the region to boost multi-sector approaches linking education, food security and nutrition for human capital development, using two complementary approaches: school feeding and social protection systems.To continue to monitor food security and livelihoods, CARICOM and WFP completed a sixth round of the food security and livelihoods survey. The survey results revealed that 3.7 million out of 7.1 million people, or 52 percent of the population of the English-speaking Caribbean, remain food insecure. While this is a 10 percent decrease when compared to an August 2022 survey, the results highlighted growing financial hardship and challenges due to the rising cost of living in the aftermath of the pandemic. The surveys continue to play a critical role in informing analysis and decision-making for governments and development partners in the region and have significantly contributed to the current prioritization of the food security agenda. In August 2023, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for Guyana. According to the report, people continue to experience challenges to their livelihoods due to the current cost of living crisis. Most respondents to the survey reported significant price increases in food, housing, gas, health and fuels and food consumption patterns show challenges with food security in the country. https://www.wfp.org/publications/caribbean-food-security-livelihoods-survey-may-2023",165302.0,129731.52,106398.53,-,165302.0,136164.17,115709.41,-,,,,-,,,,-

Working closely with the Ministries of Education and Agriculture, WFP focused on enhancing community-based school feeding initiatives by linking local farmers to school supply chains. This initiative aims to provide nutritious, locally sourced meals for students while strengthening local agricultural systems. Key milestones during the year included finalizing the project‚Äôs pilot and conducting scoping missions, which assessed current community-based school feeding activities through focus group discussions and interviews with stakeholders such as farmers, school administrators, and school feeding committees. The assessment identified strengths, challenges, and opportunities for integrating more local produce into school menus.As part of these efforts, a two-day workshop was held in partnership with the National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute (NAREI), where 28 farmers (22 women and 6 men) in Wauna, Region One, were trained in climate-smart agriculture, nursery management, cost of production, contract farming, and crop husbandry. A similar workshop was conducted in Nappi, Region Nine, benefitting 47 farmers (25 females and 22 males). These capacity-building workshops were aimed at equipping local farmers with the capacity to sustainably support the school feeding program in their communities. Another key achievement was WFP‚Äôs demonstration of the School Menu Planner (SMP) PLUS tool for the Ministry of Education, which expressed strong interest in integrating SMP PLUS into the national school feeding program. WFP is now working with the Ministry to develop a training concept and rollout plan for SMP PLUS.For 2025, WFP will focus on finalizing the school feeding project by implementing training for participating schools to enhance menu diversity and local food inclusion. WFP will also assess training effectiveness, make necessary adjustments, and develop a comprehensive implementation plan for SMP PLUS with detailed technical requirements and timelines.In line with its ongoing efforts to strengthen vulnerability analysis and address gaps in data management for stronger food systems and greater shock response. WFP completed the 7th round of the Food Security and Livelihoods survey in May 2024. Findings showed that while food insecurity decreased by 17 percent compared to the previous year, approximately three million people still face moderate to severe food insecurity, a figure 78 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2020. The survey underscored that the most vulnerable groups, including low-income households and individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses, remain disproportionately affected, with nearly one-third of respondents reporting low resilience to natural hazards. Specific to Guyana, WFP published a country-specific Food Security and Livelihood Survey summary for the country. According to the report, high cost of livelihood inputs continues to be the main contributor for disrupting livelihoods in the country, as reported by 70 percent of respondents. Households in Guyana continue to rely on negative coping strategies to meet their immediate food needs and food consumption patterns have shown very slight improvements.",383174.0,345681.91,286140.84,-,,,,-,,,,-

In partnership with the Ministry of Human Development, Families and Indigenous People‚Äôs Affairs WFP launched the Hurricane Lisa Assistance Program (HLAP) in February and provided 2,119 individuals with cash assistance to meet their food and essential needs. A second programme was launched in July with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security  Enterprise to assist smallholder farmers who were impacted by the hurricane but previously excluded from the first programme. Under the Hurricane Lisa Recovery Assistance Program (HLRAP) a total of 2,959 smallholder farmers and their families received a total of BZD 1,000 through a digital mobile wallet.
