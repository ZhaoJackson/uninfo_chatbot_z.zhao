This increased the visibility of transgender and gender non-conforming people and their needs, built capacity of not just the team at TransWave but of other trans and gender non-conforming advocates, encouraged community leadership, internal growth and stronger advocacy efforts that is and will continue to benefit our community greatly. The following outputs were achieved: 103 persons engaged (43 police officers, 2 social workers, 2 CSO representatives, 56 trans community members). The activity also included consultation sessions with trans community members to get their feedback on their interactions with service providers and how service can be improved and more gender affirming. 8 IECs produced which reached 15,529 online. The IECs related to trans health and wellness, including the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and PrEP. Three (3) videos were developed around mental health and well-being of trans persons in the workplace, identifying methods of affirmation in the workspace to boost employee morale and personal mental health.‚ÄØ 13 ambassadors engaged‚ÄØand 3 trans-led initiatives developed‚ÄØas a result. 10 of the 13 participants (76.9%) showed an increase in knowledge around trans-specific advocacy.‚ÄØ100% of ambassadors willing to implement advocacy activities‚ÄØ Engagement and building capacity of trans-masculine people.

Due to this, more people were reached to learn more about the lived experiences of trans and gender non-conforming Jamaicans daily.  Through the residential training, participants felt empowered to advocate for legal reform that protects the rights of transgender individuals in Jamaica. They expressed that they found the training to be useful and gained valuable information as it pertains to advocacy methods and resources, and how much work TransWave must do in the background to advocate for the rights and inclusions of the trans community. The activity allowed TransWave to strengthen partnerships with other trans focused groups to promote increased visibility for the community. Participants included representatives from TranscendX, Cari-Trans Support Group, TransForm, Totally Inspiring Trans (TiTs) and Solidarity Yaad.   TransWave offered support to Cari-Trans which aided them in providing support to the trans-masculine community. The support helped in building partnership with Cari-Trans and allowed TransWave to expand its reach and further in understanding and representing especially the trans-masculine community in Jamaica, who have expressed a desire for more representation and visibility. During a session held by Cari-Trans with support from TransWave, 15 persons across the transgender spectrum came together with six (6) of Cari-Trans‚Äô staff to discuss the challenges each community faces.  A media campaign around physical and mental health of trans persons, as well as the residential training which introduced our Trans Health Strategy to participants allowed the organisation to make some progress towards this objective. The campaigns spoke to the effects of HRT on the body and how it can be used to affirm trans persons, but the posts also shared the other effects of HRT to inform interested persons before accessing treatment. They also spoke to using HRT alongside PrEP as a way of affirming and protecting oneself simultaneously, and focused on building one‚Äôs mental health within workspaces, informing employment offices of the effects of transphobic work policies and attitudes on the mental health of trans persons.

Outputs:
500 complete collections of the General History of Africa in Portuguese were printed and distributed to public schools, key institutions and partners working on providing opportunities for a better understanding of the historical-cultural origin of African matrices in Brazil and their contributions to the construction of national identity.
A webinar took place in November 2021to demonstrate to education partners the importance of using the published materials.

Outcomes:
This project supported the recognition, among schools and educational institutions, of the value of African culture and the importance of its influence on Brazilian history. It contributed to disseminate the value of the African contribution to the history of Brazil and to promote the inclusion of Afro-descendants in the country's educational system, in addition to developing actions to promote racial equality.

New partners that followed the Webinar have contacted UNESCO for possible similar partnerships in other states in the country.

Challenges and lessons-learnt:
It was a challenge to agree on a common list for distribution and also to store the publications once they arrived. The issue was partly solved as the Office was rather empty due to the pandemic and we were able to use the meeting rooms to store the publications. This helped to accelerate the distribution process.

Contribution to C/5 and SDGs:
This project contributed to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 - Quality education, as well as to SDG 10 - Reduction of Inequalities, in addition to contributing to SHS ER1 and the struggle against racial inequalities, it also contributed to ED ER 1.",6043.0,4954.55,3779.13,"The project ended in February of 2022.

In 2020, more than 8.6 million enrollments were registered by the Higher Education Census, with 1.2 million graduating students. In addition, 3.7 million students entered an undergraduate course that year. The survey also found that 323,376 teachers worked at the educational level in 2020. The survey revealed 2,457 higher education institutions in Brazil on the census reference date. Of these, 2,153 (87.6%) are private and 304 (12.4%) are public. Private institutions registered 3.2 million new entrants, representing 86% of the total.
 
Public universities and federal technical institutes in Brazil are now required to reserve at least 50% of the vacancies for the following students:
who have completed high school in public schools (schooling criteria);
with income per capita of up to a minimum wage and a half (socioeconomic criterion);
with a proportional distribution of vacancies among blacks, browns, and indigenous people (ethnic-racial criterion).
 
 
Considering the main results of the last semester, the Project managed to achieve the main proposed results, that is:
Studies on the effectiveness of public universities and higher education institutions on the National Student Assistance Program - PNAES, from 2016 to 2020.
Studies analyze ?ows and methodologies to provide further ef?ciency and e?ectiveness to tax regularity within the scope of the University for All Program (Prouni).
Study to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the internationalization actions of Brazilian Federal Institutions of Higher Education (IFES). 
Developed an analytical study for the adequacy of public universities in the context of the vacancies offered and the number of first-year students.
Developed an analytical study regarding the redistribution of vacancy posts among Public universities. 
Study to identify the impacts of COVID-19 on the Student-Graduate Agreement Program (PEC-G) and the Milton Santos Program for Access to Higher Education ( PROMISES).
 
The pandemic improved the Ministry of Education's relationship with higher education institutions, as well as higher education in Brazil. Health courses, priority and educational strategies were prioritized.
 
Contribution to Global Priority Gender Equality:
Considering that the enrollment profile of women in Brazilian public universities is predominantly concentrated on women, this population group ends up benefiting from the actions developed by the project. That is, the evaluation of the profile of university entrances, as well as the analysis of funding for payment of private universities, proportionally benefits young women. This project contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and UNESCO's global priority for gender equity. The actions guarantee equal access and permanence for all in higher education.

Contribution to Priority Group Youth:
Teenagers and young people are the primary students at Public universities in Brazil. The universities could be linked to the central government, states, and municipalities. The universities' object of this project intervention is the universities connected to the ministry of education, called federal universities. Students at Brazilian higher education institutions have an evident profile: they are white, female, aged between 19 and 24, study in private institutions at night, completed high school in a public school, live with their parents, and have to work to earn an income of up to two minimum wages. In both public and private higher education institutions, most students come from public high schools. In the case of private higher education, 68.5% of students came from public high schools and 31.5% from private. In public higher education institutions, 60.1% came from public high schools, and 39.9% came from private high schools.

2) Main difficulties
The project is still very new, and the project team is not yet familiar with UNESCO's hiring and accountability processes.
 
3) Potential risks and mitigation measures
As the project team, on the part of FNDE, does not yet know in depth the necessary procedures for the execution of the project, there was a risk of hiring being done outside the expected standard. As a mitigation measure, the team has been going through a series of training with the UNESCO team, in order to feel safe to carry out the necessary actions.
 
4) Lessons learned
An important lesson was the constant need for communication and training of FNDE's staff, to ensure that all hirings and accountability are correct.

A consultant finalized the training manual based on the existing draft and feedback from the internal review process. A Handbook with content from the manual and the training handouts was also compiled and finalized by the consultant. As part of this project, 27 secondary HFLE teachers were trained in a 4-day residential Sexuality Education training workshop held on October 18-20, 2024, at the Ocean Coral Spring Hotel in Trelawny. The workshop aimed to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills to improve the delivery of the Sexuality and Sexual Health theme in HFLE, as well as increase their comfort level in delivering topics related to sexual and reproductive health.  The training was consistent with the then near-finalized sexuality education training manual and covered six modules as follows:¬∑     Introduction to Sexuality Education¬∑     Understanding Sexuality and Sexual Health Education¬∑     Understanding Sexual Development¬∑     Knowledge Empowers (SRH)¬∑     Gender¬∑     Gender-based Violence All 27 teachers completed the evaluation for the workshop. Only 1 teacher left the workshop in need of immediate support around Gender vs Sex. Areas of interest from the teachers for further capacity building were Human Trafficking, Sexting  Revenge Pornography, Cervical Cancer, Sexual Grooming, social media, and Accessing Health Services. Capacity building sessions will therefore be organized in these areas as resources become available. There is tremendous need for consistent engagement and support for educators tasked with delivering the HFLE Curriculum in schools. This is critical because while information about HIV and AIDS and young people‚Äôs sexual and reproductive health needs is readily available, the knowledge levels among educators vary.

Efforts are ongoing to enhance the knowledge, skills and competencies of approximately 5,417 parents, ECD practitioners, teachers and key stakeholders across 10 programme countries and territories to provide 13,426 girls and boys, ages 0-8 with nurturing care, learning and holistic development in safe, protective and enriching environments.Training and capacity development remain important strategies employed in the ECD sector strengthening the information base, skills, and competencies of parents, ECD practitioners, teachers, and other stakeholders to enhance child engagement and support quality play for holistic development and sustainable learning, including in emergencies. Approximately 5,417 key stakeholders in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago , Virgin Islands UK and the Turks and Caicos Islands benefitted from professional development sessions in supporting home-based learning, using materials effectively in structured play to enhance numeracy, literacy, language and communication , learning to identify and respond to children showing signs of developmental delay and integrating technology using online platforms with content for young learners.Advocacy and communication were key mediums for sharing information on quality ECD with targeted stakeholders and the public. The Ministry of Education in Grenada, with the support of the Ministries of Health and Social Development implemented an intersectoral advocacy campaign to ensure that the public had access to information about the overall benefits of quality ECD for children, families and the wider community emphasizing topics such as early brain development, active learning, positive parenting, keeping children safe, health and nutrition etc. Information was shared via social media platforms, television, radio with more than 4,000 views on the Ministry‚Äôs website.Using the generation of evidence as a critical strategy to support systematic planning, decision-making and to advance policy initiatives for inclusive ECD and Education, UNICEF ECA supported the comprehensive Diagnostic Review of the status of the ECD Sector in the 12 programming countries and territories. Consultations reflected the perspectives of more than 200 key informants across the region. The data revealed positive progress in key areas - implementation of ECD Policies, Standards and Regulatory Frameworks for provision of quality ECD services, the utilization of Regional Frameworks promoting effective curriculum delivery through child friendly environments for purposeful play and utilization of operational guidance promoting compliance with quality standards. Positive progress was reflected in training for parents, ECD practitioners and other caregivers on supporting holistic development in homes and communities, keeping the focus on Early Moments Matter. The research also revealed that there is more to be done to support countries to implement integrated approaches for planning, implementing, and monitoring of ECD programmes and services across the sectors of Education, Health, and Social Development.In collaboration with the respective governments, UNICEF supported the comprehensive review and updating of the ECD Policy, Regulations and Standards Frameworks in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Montserrat with these countries placing significant emphasis on the articulation of more integrated approaches to ECD for children 0-8 years. Going forward UNICEF ECA will support the implementation of Policy Initiatives including strengthening mechanisms for effective governance, coordination, implementation and monitoring of integrated ECD programmes, support for holistic development in homes and communities and support for early identification, intervention, and improved learning outcomes for children with developmental delays/disabilities.Through UNICEF support, the Ministry of Education in St. Kitts and Nevis strengthened and supported the establishment of Toy Lending Libraries. These libraries support the principles of learning through play by providing ECD Service providers and teachers with access to developmentally appropriate materials and equipment for learning on a rotation basis. Six hundred and fifty-two (652) ECD practitioners, Teachers and Centre supervisors benefitted from professional development sessions which focused on building their capacity to make multi-purpose use of toys and manipulatives, to enhance child engagement, development and learning. Approximately 2,069 children, 0-5 years are enjoying more interactive and structured play using the materials being borrowed from the Toy Lending Libraries.The Integrated approach to ECD at country level has proven to be highly effective to support holistic development of young children. It now requires institutionalization and development of mechanisms both at the country level as well as at UNICEF internally to further strengthened integration approach across health, education and social development sectors.A key partnership with the Child Development and Guidance Centre and the Ministry of Education in St. Lucia resulted in the completion of an online learning platform and the launching of a new e-learning web series for young learners called Kaleidoscope Adventures. The website provides access to learning activities for children, 0-5 years and is part of a wider project which aimed to provide parents, teachers and other caregivers with knowledge and skills, and to support learning and development at home and in communities. This initiative was born as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw children in the ECD sector with limited access to quality play and learning in their homes. Since the launch in the first quarter of 2022, more than 5,000 children and families have accessed the platform and engaged with the activities.",104000.0,78139.58,60422.97,"GrenadaIn collaboration with the Ministry of Education, UNICEF supported Professional Development Training Workshops during the Summer Holidays for Pre-primary and Kindergarten Teachers from Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.

Youth engagement and participation in safe school initiative have been enhanced. In addition, the Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA) initiative as part of Generation Unlimited was commenced with the aim to provide a digital marketplace for youths.UNICEF ECA continued its support towards providing better digital learning opportunities for children in the countries of the region. In partnership with the OECS, 900 curriculum aligned digital learning contents for K-6 grades have been developed and are ready to be launched for public dissemination in early 2023. This provides digital learning opportunity to primary education students in five participating countries: Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis. 400 teachers have been trained in the use of digital content development tools to create these learning resources. In addition, UNICEF ECA collaborated with Ministry of Education in Turks and Caicos Islands, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada and Barbados to enrich digital learning resources for kindergarten, primary and secondary education. As a result, the capacity of 268 teachers and Education officials across six countries have been enhanced in effective use of digital skills in producing high quality digital learning resources. Consequently, 25,768 digital learning resources were developed. It is expected that 145,000 children and 11,400 teachers in the six countries will benefit from usage of these resources, which will contribute to improved learning outcome for students. UNICEF provided further support to the Ministry of Education in Trinidad and Tobago in developing five digital textbooks for primary and secondary. Moreover, newly developed self-training toolkit on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skill to use the Ministry's Learning Management System as well as web-based pedagogy instruction was used to train 100 primary and secondary education officers. These were also made available in both hard (500) and soft copies to allow access for all teachers. Some 456 students from vulnerable families in Trinidad and Tobago benefitted from the provision of a laptop in support of their continuity of learning. In terms of connectivity, UNICEF worked with ITU to pilot a capacity expansion project in primary and secondary schools in Barbados. This project included an assessment of usage and temporary upgrades for selected schools. Subsequent assessments will be completed to collect quantitative data on usage and the impact of expanded access and capacity at the given schools. With UNICEF ECA contribution, the 3rd Ministerial Forum of the Caribbean Safe School Initiative (CSSI) and Youth Forum during 11th Caribbean Disaster Management Conference were organized successfully. The forums offered the opportunity to reflect upon the changes and challenges the Caribbean has faced since launching the CSSI. They also provided the platform for youth to engage in discussion and express their voice and opinion on the issue.As part of GenU initiative, UNICEF ECA commenced the rolling out of YOMA in Trinidad and Tobago with the aim to establish it as one of the primary mechanisms to engage, reach, and impact young people. As part of the initiative, social impact activities aimed at motivating and engaging youth more actively in addressing some key issues related to youth entrepreneurship, climate change are being designed. Moreover, preparation works to launch a localized YOMA platform in first quarter of 2023 have commenced.ÔªøA key lesson learned was the fact that blended education, especially the online delivery of education, is much more complex than previously thought. Curriculum based Content development, connectivity and availability of devices are just a few initial steps. Strategic planning needs to take place at the ministerial level, at the school level and classrooms for effective and efficient delivery. If an appropriate stepwise strategy is not devised, premature delivery of online education can further enhance the digital divide contributing to further inequity for the already disadvantaged groups.In addition to respective Ministries of Education in the countries, UNICEF ECA continued its partnership with regional bodies such as the OECS and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) to implement digital learning and safe school related initiatives.

High-level advocacy briefs on the legal status of corporal punishment in all 12 programme countries, development of a draft Victims‚Äô Rights Policy and 19 new draft laws against gender-based violence in Grenada, and the opening of the child-friendly Family Court Division in Antigua and Barbuda were among initiatives which have the potential for long-term, transformative impact for protecting girls, boys and women through legal and policy reform and institutional strengthening. The Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) registered an uptick in gun-related violence, family violence as well as school-based interpersonal violence among peers, sustaining concern over the issue of Violence Against Children (VAC). UNICEF supported governments to continue tackling the issue through a multi-pronged approach. Within this output, UNICEF supported governments through technical assistance to improve their institutional frameworks to prevent and respond to VAC. There were several notable achievements. One was the production of key advocacy briefs towards ending state sanctioned use of corporal punishment. This resulted in increased knowledge of stakeholders on the legal status of corporal punishment in each of the 12 ECA countries and territories, where the eye-opening research highlighted persistent legislative gaps. In Grenada, a draft Victims‚Äô Right Policy and 19 pieces of draft legislation for ending family and gender-based violence are being considered by the new administration. In Antigua and Barbuda, the first Family Court Division was opened in July 2022, with the technical and financial support of UNICEF. Cases can be lodged via the e-portal and the people-centred nature of the court whether through in-person or virtual hearings, is already helping reduce stigma associated with gender-based violence and child abuse, making the process more user-friendly, efficient and effective. In Trinidad and Tobago, a National Protocol for the Prevention and Management of Child Abuse and National Child Safeguarding Strategy were delivered in support of government‚Äôs response to curtailing VAC. This was also supported by the roll-out of Primero Child Protection Case Management Information System increasing the capacity of frontline workers by reducing administrative burdens and supporting better quality case work. The issue of children‚Äôs online safety was brought to the fore with programming through the OECS Education Unit and associated awareness building of approximately 121 frontline workers to improve the safety of children‚Äôs online presence. Lastly, advocacy and support were provided to the Barbados and St Kitts and Nevis governments to ensure that forthcoming legislation eliminates all forms of corporal punishment to better adhere to the international standards for children‚Äôs alternative care.    The use of corporal punishment and the belief that it is a necessary form of discipline to reduce the surge in general societal violence is widespread. Policymakers have also demonstrated an understanding that community crime undermines positive parenting. However, they were hesitant to take bold legislative changes that negatively affected public opinion. Another challenge was the increased school-based violence, where teachers and children needed to re-embrace the positive behaviour management strategies after two straight years of online interaction caused by the COIVD-19 measures. This temporary phenomenon gave rise to political promises for harsher responses to ‚Äòsoft approaches‚Äô on children in Antigua and Barbuda ahead of general elections. Together these realities mean that UNICEF ECA‚Äôs consistent advocacy and support for the development and implementation of new laws, policies, protocols, and attitudes to support the prevention and response to VAC will be critical over the medium to long term.  ÔªøGlobally, as more countries legally prohibit the practice of corporal punishment and document their circumstances, a lesson learned for the Eastern Caribbean is that apart from use of countries‚Äô parliamentary processes to outlaw the use of physical force against children, activists will need to consider other strategies for accelerating banning corporal punishment through public interest litigation and judicial condemnation.   Strategic partnerships with global actors End Corporal Punishment and the European Union/United Nations Spotlight programme, together with relevant national Child Protection agencies, ministries of legal affairs [and their legal drafting departments and the civil society organization (CSO)], Grenada National Organisation of Women, were critical to the systems strengthening initiatives implemented in 2022. The latter championed policy and legislative initiatives while the CSO partner was key in public awareness activities as they link to historically marginalized communities. In addition, in both Spotlight countries - Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective Spotlight Working Groups offer support needed to drive the policy and legislative agenda across the sectoral work of the many UN partners. ",146000.0,123682.84,111022.64,"Dominica:In 2023, UNICEF and other partners‚Äô long-term advocacy resulted in the parliamentary approval of key laws that ban behaviour that can harm children or require action to protect children. This suite of laws comprised the Children (Care and Adoption) Act, which provides for the care and protection of children, operation of adoption services and for related matters; Domestic Violence Act which provides greater protection for victims of domestic violence and makes provision for granting protection orders and for related matters; Maintenance of Children Act which provides for maintenance of children in conformity with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the connected and incidental matters; and the Status of Children Act which provides for equal status of children, removes all discriminatory provisions in the laws relating to a child born out of wedlock and provides for related matters.GrenadaThrough the EU UN Joint Spotlight on gender-based violence (GBV), UNICEF collaborated with PAHO to ensure that 75 service providers knew how to apply the draft Victims‚Äô/Survivors‚Äô Rights Policy and the standard operating procedures to their work with the affected population. UNICEF technical assistance also supported the near finalization of bills to improve the legislative framework for preventing and responding to GBV. This includes an outright ban on preventing pregnant girls from mainstream education and on the use of corporal punishment in educational settings. The accountability mechanism for the draft Victims‚Äô/Survivors‚Äô Rights Policy was established to ensure cabinet approval of the policy before year-end. To facilitate passage of the draft legislation, UNICEF ensured that parliamentarians had strengthened capacity to use parliamentary procedures, integrate gender concerns into their ongoing work in the Houses of Parliament and take specific bipartisan actions to address gender-based and family violence, as this will be key to the societal transformations required.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines UNICEF supported the Child Development Division, Ministry of National Mobilisation in the implementation of the Primero Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS+) to enhance child protection systems strengthening in emergency and non-emergency settings and improve case management from identification and registration, to assessment, case planning, referrals and transfers, and case closure.",235136.5,175743.21,149248.46,-,235136.5,172710.29,136301.52,-,,,,-,,,,-

Among these groups are youth, drug users, migrants, sex workers, MSM, transvestites, and homeless people. It is estimated that people with less than 25 years now are half of the new HIV infections, which justifies targeted approaches and the construction of specific strategies for preventing disease in the school environment. This scenario demands an investment of human, financial, and technological structures for effective responses to the epidemic based on two complementary axes that require coordinated approaches: prevention and reducing impacts.The Project focused on designed new prevention methodologies with the Secretariat of Education to orient the redefinition of prevention strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations targeted for adolescents and young people.As part of the scope of the Project's objectives, it is to promote studies and research on epidemiological, behavioral, and effectiveness trends in STI / HIV / AIDS. The Project, in partnership with one of the largest Brazilian universities - UFRJ - organized a working group to discuss lines of research of interest to the Project: in two components: epidemiological and socio-behavioral.It developed: a cascade of care with an estimate of those infected with HIV; epidemiological and assistance analyzes of HIV and AIDS; epidemiological analysis of viral hepatitis reports; analyzes related to notifications of pregnant women with HIV / AIDS; analyzes related to cases of congenital syphilis; analyzes similar to syphilis during pregnancy. The Project has provided Management with the development of actions that contribute to analyzing the dynamics of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the state and the strengthening of Management's governance capacity.The production and systematization of technical-scientific information have become an essential strategy for reaching health professionals and contributing to public political processes.One of the Project's most strategic strategies was civil society's participation in developing preventive actions and the development of new non-formal education technologies. Eight NGOs are being hired to reach vulnerable groups. The project will be implemented during 2023.The achievement of this objective has contributed to the expansion of sustainability and technical capacity. Moreover, the development of methodological processes that enable different ways to use technologies (media and social networks, platforms collaborative, among other initiatives) aimed at populations and population groups that require communication and dialogue alternatives for the success and incorporation of preventive measures and behaviors.It is noteworthy that the Project has gone through some political and financial crises since its beginning, impacting its implementation. So that some activities could not be carried out and some results could not be achieved. Since the signing of the Project, the Project has passed through seven state health secretaries.

In addition, videos in the areas such as Math, Physics and Chemistry that are produced by women were prioritized, when possible. Still, it has been identified that few relevant female teachers produce and disseminate videos in these areas.Given their great potential to be accessible anytime and anywhere, educational resources can be an important inclusion tool, enabling individuals from disadvantaged groups to have access to education. In addition to allowing equal access to quality educational resources among boys and girls, in the methodology to restructure the YouTube Edu channel, issues such as the balanced number of videos produced by men and women has been considered. We highlight that in addition to the playlists related to school subjects, the new YouTube Edu will have two new playlists dedicated to gender equality: a playlist dedicated to SDG 5, with videos about discrimination, infant and maternal mortality, sexual and reproductive rights, female leadership and empowerment, gender-based violence etc; and a more general playlist on gender equality, which will be placed in the general education topics playlists section.

Through resource mobilization and capacity building at the 9th Annual Statisticians Meeting, UNICEF has supported the professional development of Ministry of Education statisticians to enhance data-driven education policy and programming across member states. UNICEF‚Äôs collaboration with the OECS has made significant progress in improving educational and social outcomes for youth across the region. Through targeted initiatives, both adults and youth have contributed to enhancing education and youth development programmes. These efforts have positively impacted thousands of children and youth, creating greater learning opportunities. In total, 156 adults and 494 children/youth participated in programmes benefiting over 125,000 young people, primarily in pre-primary, primary, and secondary education. In 2024, UNICEF and the OECS Council of Ministers organized key events to advance youth development and education. The OECS Youth and Sports meeting in March engaged 300 participants, focusing on youth development. The September education meeting brought together 43 adults and 10 youth, while the Digital Curriculum Hackathon involved 17 adults and seven youth, focusing on digital education. The OECS Implementation Meeting in April focused on education policy, involving 58 adults. These events shaped educational policies, promoted youth engagement, and improved the overall learning experience in the OECS. Through the Education Council of Ministers, all nine countries have collectively and individually made a Commitment to Action for Foundational Learning. Following the 2022 Transforming Education Summit and study in seven Caribbean islands, UNICEF conducted research, consultation, and validation of the Commitment to Action for Transforming Education, in the United Kingdom Overseas Territories, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands. The research received input from a wide range of stakeholders, including premiers, governors, and education ministers, demonstrating strong political commitment to transforming education in these territories. Addressing the multifaceted challenges of reimagining education in the UKOTs requires a coordinated approach that balances regional needs with global trends. Adapting the education system is essential to equip students with skills for the future, ensuring education remains relevant and transformative. In Trinidad and Tobago, UNICEF has worked to improve the inclusivity of education for Venezuelan migrant children. A 2024 amendment to the immigration regulations allows children under 18, registered under the 2019 Migrant Registration Framework, to attend national schools. As chair of the Education Working Group, UNICEF has collaborated with the Ministry of Education to develop a system for registering these children. To date, 60 children have been enrolled in 22 schools. UNICEF continues to support the Ministry in addressing the needs of both migrant and local children. Additionally, UNICEF has partnered with eight community-based organizations running 18 child-friendly spaces, offering informal education and services to migrant children. Despite these efforts, access to formal education remains hindered by the legislative framework. UNICEF continues advocating for the inclusion of all migrant and refugee children. Through ongoing advocacy and capacity-building, UNICEF champions cultural acceptance and broader inclusion.  Promoting Accessibility. UNICEF and the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education provided eye screenings to facilitate glasses for approximately 600 children in need. By December 2024, 328 of over 1,200 students received glasses, improving their engagement in learning. Progress was also made in the Caribbean Safe School Initiative across eight participating states. Six countries - Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Barbados, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - approved the CSSI policy, and a monitoring tool was developed. A cost-cutting proposal for the Secretariat, supported by CDEMA, was completed, and discussions for further funding are ongoing. Additionally, 346 educators were trained in disaster risk management, impacting over 5,000 students and 3,950 parents. The migration of over 9,000 curriculum-based digital content items to ministry of education platforms in Barbados, Dominica, Grenada and Turks and Caicos Islands is progressing, with completion expected by April 2025. Capacity-building programmes for teachers in Barbados will be completed by March 2025, with a detailed support programme set for early 2025. The integration of technology, including AI and emerging technologies, is reshaping global education, making it essential for the UKOTs to update their educational offerings. Strategic investments in innovation are necessary to build a resilient education system that empowers youth, enhances global competitiveness, and drives sustainable development. The GIGA initiative has improved education in the Eastern Caribbean by enhancing school connectivity and resilience. It has developed the Children‚Äôs Climate Risk Index-Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM) and helped ministries address connectivity gaps.

During 2022 UNHCR continued its community-based ESL classes for Waroe and Spanish speaking out of school children in different indigenous communities of Region 1. The community-based classes aim at providing children with the most basic skills in preparation for enrollment in formal schooling, while awaiting space to become available. The project is run through direct implementation by UNHCR in coordination with the Toushous and community leaders and provides also employment opportunities within the communities through the UNV Programme. A total of 7 UN Community Volunteers were employed and some 147 indigenous out of school children enrolled. In addition, UNHCR established a partnership agreement with the Ministry of Education to provide after school ESL classes to Venezuelan and Guyanese returnee children enrolled in the formal education system. In regions 1, 3 and 7, a total of 472 children attended the after-school classes, while capacity strengthening training in ESL has been delivered to teachers from 14 schools. UNHCR considers education as a core right, thus it contributed to strengthen the capacity of schools and the Ministry of Education. Throughout 2022, UNHCR procured and donated various types of equipment and school supplies. All children enrolled in the ESL after-school classes received learning materials, and schools were equipped with tablets and school furniture. In addition, UNHCR supported the newly established Migrant Support and Risk Management Unit of the MoE with various office supplies. UNHCR also supported the Ministry with the development of the first ESL Curriculum and Diagnostic Assessment tools in Guyana.
