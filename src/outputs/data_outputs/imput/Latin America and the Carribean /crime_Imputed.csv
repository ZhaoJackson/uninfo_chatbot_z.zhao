The launch of the platform, which marked the culmination of 5 years of collaborative work, was deployed in police stations in ANB, BRB, GRN, VCT and SKN. Of the 51 combined stations stations across these jurisdictions that have the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the system, 80% have fully onboarded the PRMIS platform and are relying on it for management of crime data. In ANB, 100% of stations had been operationalised by year-end. To support the effective utilisation for the data to make informed crime prevention decisions and to ultimately reduce the number of victims of intentional homicide (SP Outcome 3, Indicator 5), over 1,000 police officers were capacitated to undertake data collection and crime analysis, with more than 50 trained as trainers to support sustainability. This work contributed directly to the UNDP Strategic Plan Signature Solution Indicator 2.3.1.ChallengesÔªøIn some jurisdictions, lack of ICT infrastructure within some police stations prevented the full deployment of the PRMIS system. While an initial assessment of the national capacity to roll-out the platform had been undertaken, it did not fully reflect the status at each individual police station and it was later recognised that some critical elements including internet connectivity remained a challenge and prevented more uptake of the digitalisation programme. As a result, some of the hardware deployed in previous periods was not fully utilised and it was not possible to operationalise PRMIS and in these instances the roll-out was delayed and could not be completed by year-end.",638136.0,547260.29,456696.57,"CARISECURE 2.0 (as at June 2023)The budget for 2023 was at the time entered, envisioned to focus on salaries, therefore the expenditure entered also reflects salaries.

Ce manuel vise √† √©tablir une base de connaissances fondamentale. S'appuyant sur cette initiative, l'ONUDC a commenc√© √† d√©velopper des outils plus complets, y compris un programme de formation d√©taill√© sur la lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers, ainsi que des directives sur la conduite √©thique et l'int√©grit√© pour les professionnels du droit, mettant en avant leur r√¥le dans la lutte contre la corruption, qui doivent √™tre finalis√©s en 2024.De plus, l'ONUDC a lanc√© l'√©valuation des proc√©dures internes de l'ULCC, avec une m√©thodologie partag√©e et approuv√©e par les homologues nationaux. Cette √©valuation devrait √™tre achev√©e en 2024.En outre, l'ONUDC et l'OEA ont fait des progr√®s significatifs dans la promotion de la coop√©ration internationale pour soutenir les autorit√©s ha√Øtiennes dans leur lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers. Cela inclut la facilitation de l'adh√©sion √† des r√©seaux internationaux tels que GLOBE et la facilitation de l'√©tablissement de coop√©rations internationales avec plusieurs √âtats, renfor√ßant ainsi le cadre global et la capacit√© √† aborder ces questions critiques.De plus, l'ONUDC et l'OEA ont avanc√© strat√©giquement le cadre pour soutenir les autorit√©s ha√Øtiennes dans la lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers. Cela a impliqu√© le d√©veloppement et le d√©ploiement d'outils et de modules de formation cibl√©s con√ßus pour am√©liorer les comp√©tences et les connaissances des principaux acteurs du syst√®me judiciaire et des forces de l'ordre ha√Øtiens.

The second aim is to promote cooperation between Brazil, Peru and Colombia in combatting transnational organized crime in the Amazon region.One of the project‚Äôs main focuses is capacity-building: in Brazil, 344 prison agents received training, with an average improvement of 60,1% in their knowledge, based on pre- and post-training testing. It also promoted South-South cooperation between Brazil and Paraguay, resulting in 235 Paraguayan officers participating in training sessions conducted by Brazilian experts. In Paraguay, one of the activities was a Training of Trainers (ToT) in Prison Matters; by December 2023, these instructors had trained an additional 373 prison officers.PRIS-COOP organized several capacity-building and policy-focused activities. In Brazil, the project promoted seven (07) training sessions in partnership with the National Secretariat of Penal Policies (SENAPPEN). The project focused on strengthening state-level capacities in prison intelligence, training prison unit directors at the state and federal levels on dynamic security and enhancing the capacities of instructors of the National School for Criminal Services of SENAPPEN. In Paraguay, UNODC facilitated the organization of three (03) training sessions in partnership with Brazilian government agencies at the federal and state levels. The first course, in April, was on prison procedures and routines for the students at the Higher Technical Penitentiary Institute (ITSP) of Paraguay; then, in October, PRIS-COOP held a Training of Trainers on the theme. The third activity was aimed at prison unit Directors, to bolster leadership skills.  Additionally, PRIS-COOP supported four (04) international workshops to promote prison cooperation and police cooperation to address transnational organized crime within and outside prison settings. In parallel, UNODC worked to support Brazil and Paraguay in the theme of the classification of prisoners. In Paraguay, PRIS-COOP supported the development of general guidelines and an action plan for the development of a national classification system.In Brazil, UNODC was appointed as an official member of the National Technical Working Group to elaborate a National Standard on the Classification of Prisoners of the National Secretariat of Penitentiary Policies. The group will propose parameters for the implementation and operationalization of classification by the Brazilian states. UNODC was also invited to support the training of personnel on the SENAPPEN-supported pilot project on the classification of prisoners in Rio Grande do Norte, a Brazilian state which suffered a series of attacks against public buildings, businesses, public and private vehicles by prison-based organized groups in early 2023.",600000.0,488837.24,387267.9,"Under UNODC‚Äôs mandate to safeguard and implement The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules, and in line with the United Nations System Common Position on Incarceration, over 4,100 prisoners underwent classification interviews in three Brazilian states with UNODC support. In Amap√°, the entire prison population (3,317 people) was interviewed by nurses, psychologists, and social workers to identify individual needs (https://tinyurl.com/34kmkcz7). Classification is highlighted in both abovementioned documents as imperative in promoting the resocialization of prisoners, guaranteeing prisoners‚Äô rights ‚Äì especially to access basic services, work, and education ‚Äì and improving security for prisoners and prison staff alike. After the initial interviews, each state must advance in 2025 in drafting Individualized Sentence Plans that will contain each prisoner‚Äôs personal plan in view of access to education, work, health needs, and more.

In 2023, in the scope of ECOS‚Äô action on forest crimes, UNODC conducted a study on the creation of images and near-infrared spectra databases of 15 key species of native wood in national and international trade and/or listed in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).The database will be used to improve algorithms applied in timber identification, with the goal creating of a tool for use in the field by law enforcement and environmental inspection agents. Such a tool would strengthen the response of these institutions in combatting illegal logging, while also contributing to the construction of more robust evidence for criminal investigations related to environmental crimes.UNODC and the Brazilian Forestry Service plan to launch an application in late 2024 based on the final algorithm. Project ECOS held the Regional Workshop for the Advancement of Timber Identification Field Techniques at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden in November 2023 to present the preliminary results of the research and to strengthen inter-institutional work in the area.In the scope of minerals-related crimes, ECOS also held in Brasilia the 7th Informal Law Enforcement Network Meeting on Minerals-Related Crimes in cooperation with the World Customs Organization, the Government of France, USAID, and the European Union. The meeting connected relevant government officials and non-governmental organizations to strengthen information exchange related to the production and trade of mineral resources, including precious metals and stones.Additionally, the UNODC projects ECOS and Tapaj√≥s organized in Brasilia the first International Conference on Mercury Trafficking, in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change. The conference had the objective of discussing emerging trends and challenges related to illicit mercury trafficking and gathered representatives from the Federal Government, security forces, environmental inspection agencies, embassies, the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and civil society.Finally, within the fronts of action of wildlife trafficking and illegal fishing, UNODC organized the Indicator Framework Exercise of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in November in Bras√≠lia.

The genera, which include famous trees such as Ip√™, Cumaru, and Cedro-rosa, are included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  Following a multi-stakeholder diagnosis of Brazilian normative on crimes against wildlife, UNODC launched the ‚ÄòCountry Report: ICCWC Indicator Framework for Combating Crime against Wildlife‚Äô in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MMA) in 2023. Now, UNODC is supporting IBAMA in drafting the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Combat of Wildlife Crimes in consultation with relevant partners (https://tinyurl.com/mpw5vs3e).

After the launching event, 43 IBAMA professionals were trained on how to apply the new norm. The Statement on Non-Prejudicial Exploitation, the founding part of the regulation, was built with the participation of more than 120 professionals.  UNODC is leading the development of two portable timber identification tools: one based on imaging and another on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); early in the year, both techniques showed promising results in the field (https://tinyurl.com/9x6vmcds).

AIRCOP is a  multi agency project based on the cooperation between  UNODC,  INTERPOL and  the World Customs Organisations (WCO) that aims at  strengthening the capacities of participating  international airports in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East to  detect and intercept drugs, other illicit goods (including firearms, their parts and ammunition) and high-risk passengers (including victims of trafficking in persons and foreign terrorist fighters) in origin, transit and destination countries with the overall objective of  disrupting the illegal criminal networks. 
The increased capacity and knowledge of trained personnel has led to the expansion of the project scope to cover the multiple  threats targeting airports, including all illicit drugs, illicit goods (such as wildlife, counterfeit medicines or weapons) and, as of late, terrorism and trafficking in persons.
In 2022, UNODC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for the implementation of the AIRCOP Programme at the Piarco International Airport in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. To date, 8 vetted officers from the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS), the Immigration Department, the Customs Agency have been assigned to form the AIRCOP Task Force.
AIRCOP provides a range of standard and specialized training and mentoring activities, tailored tonational and regional needs. Topics covered include intelligence collection and sharing, targeting, search techniques, counterfeit documents, behavioral analysis, use ofl aw enforcement databases, secure communication procedures and post-seizure investigations, as well as specific thematic issues.
In 2022, UNODC facilitated training for the AIRCOP Task Force in the following areas:
-	AIRCOP Introductory Training
-	AIRCOP Training on Integrity in Law Enforcement
-	AIRCOP Training on Gender and Human Rights in Law Enforcement
-	Specialized Training on the Safe Handling of Synthetic Opiods, use of Raman Drug Testing Devices and Drug Precursor Kits
-	Specialized Training on Intelligence and Data (API and Passenger data)
-	Specialized Training on the Use of the WCO CENComm Platform
