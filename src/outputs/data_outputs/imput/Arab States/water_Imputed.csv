In 2021, FAO provided technical assistance to the Ministry of works, Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning in formulating the National Food Security Strategy 2020 ‚Äì 2030 in Bahrain. The formulation engaged a wide range of stakeholders in close coordination by the Steering Committee headed by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Resources. The preparation of the Strategy was supported by the Technical Taskforce established by government, consisting of representatives from the government and civil society institutions. The strategy recommends on some core components for food security, notably it has targeted local food production system, investment, trade, national strategic reserve management, food waste, nutrition and food safety, as well as cross-cutting issues related to data and information systems, climate change  natural resource management and sustainability. 

Develop / strengthen the food and agricultural statistics system of Bahrain, with a focus on crops and livestock 

Following consultations with stakeholders, the assessment of the agricultural statistics system has been prepared. This has served to complete the draft Strategic Plan for Agriculture Statistics (SPAS), which provides the framework for the development of the Statistical System over the next five years. FAO assisted in developing the Bahrain Agriculture Survey methodology (questionnaire, manuals and methodological documents) and discussed with the Bahrain Technical Team and submitted to government. FAO provided the needed survey tools, which contribute to developing capacity of national staff to independently implement the survey, process, analyze and publish data.  

Strengthen sustainable development of the aquaculture sector 

In 2021, the within the frame of the ‚ÄúSupporting the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector in Bahrain‚Äù FAO implemented several activities, including conducted a) design of a new hatchery to accommodate the production objectives of the government; b) study on the best options for phytoplankton production in the hatchery for the feeding of the fish larvae; c) biosecurity risk assessment and development of Standard Operating Procedures for the National Mariculture Centre; and d) procurement of modern equipment. The projects provide support to the National Mariculture Centre of Ras Hayan for improving broodstock management and hatchery facilities, diversifying aquaculture products and delivering targeted training 

Develop and implement a national scheme to eradicate animal diseases and zoonosis 

Stakeholder consultation has led the establishment of a taskforce representing various ministries led by the Ministry of Works, Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning. In 2021, FAO in collaboration with the ministry has conducted surveillances to eradicate zoonotic diseases (brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR), one of the transboundary animal diseases. Serological results for brucellosis indicate that except for isolated farm, which turned positive for antibodies due to vaccination history, the disease was not found in the flocks. Serological evidence show that PPR, which never been reported in the Kingdom, has a quarter of its sheep and goats with positive antibodies. This may be attributed to vaccinating of animals with smuggled vaccines or mixing of imported animals, which were vaccinated abroad. FAO has prepared PPR Contingency/Emergency Plan for the Kingdom in order to apply for recognition of its status by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). FAO has also supported on the Bahrain‚Äôs diagnostic system, surveillance system, prevention and control system, legal framework and stakeholder involvement. 

Preliminary results of mass testing of cattle using interferon gamma assays (IGRA) revealed that over 40% (of 3856 tested) were positive. The re-testing of the positive ones with tuberculin PPD (skin test) is showing over 80% agreement with IGRA signifying the number of animals to be culled with compensation. The Kingdom has 7,880 heads of cattle and a conservative estimate for positivity would mean that at least 2,733 would be culled. Given that some animals would still be missed, we have a plan to use Ab-ELISA test to get animals with latent infection (chronically infected with advanced bovine TB). As the screening is ongoing, FAO is requesting additional compensation fund to compensate affected farmers in order to begin the culling of positive reactors to ensure the eradication.  

Prevent potential pandemics through strengthening the implementation of biosecurity improvement for emerging and re-emerging transboundary threats on food and agriculture sectors

This initiative seeks to alleviate resource strain and mitigate rising tensions among different community groups. It will be achieved through a comprehensive, integrated approach that effectively addresses specific needs while simultaneously empowering community factions to tackle mounting challenges in a way that's environmentally sustainable.

The envisioned intervention entails the development of urban farming skills for both women and youth. It also includes supplying clean water and renewable energy to key public facilities such as schools and a health dispensary. Concurrently, the project will raise community awareness regarding cholera prevention. By putting acquired skills and knowledge into practice, the project aims to enhance food security, promote hygiene, and improve sanitation conditions for vulnerable populations, including both locals and refugees residing in the Shalfeh neighborhood.

Furthermore, the interventions will play a pivotal role in heightening climate change awareness. They will introduce uncomplicated yet impactful behavioral changes aimed at fostering nature-based solutions at the urban level.

It's important to highlight that the proposed project is designed to complement the ongoing initiatives spearheaded by UN-Habitat, UN-Women, and UNICEF in Shalfeh. These initiatives are part of a project funded through the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security (UNTFHS). While the current project focuses on revamping a versatile community center to provide social and protective services primarily for vulnerable groups like women and youth, the new project will take the lead in addressing urgent basic necessities and pressing community needs.

Under this funding a state-of-art facility has been constructed and was put in operation in October 2017. Due to the economic crisis that Lebanon is experiencing since October 2019, the Lebanese Government, and relevant authorities are no longer capable of securing funds to operate the facility.

https://intranet.undp.org/sites/LBN/project/00111422/SitePages/projecthome.aspx

The Litani is the longest river in Lebanon of 170 km long with a watershed of about 2,181 Km2 (21% of the Lebanese territories including territorial waters). The pollution of the Litani Basin has been on the Government of Lebanon radar screen especially since 2011 where pressures emanating from municipal, industrial and agricultural sources were exacerbated by the Syrian displaced settling in various parts of the basin. Hence, the Litani Basin is a growing source of concern as the Upper Litani Basin (ULB) cost of environmental degradation (COED) stands at US$ 227 million in 2012 equivalent on average to 2.2% of ULB GDP and 0.5% of Lebanon GDP and must have increased since.

All project beneficiaries, including women, will be researched for a comprehensive gender assessment through focused group discussions and consultations with experts or specialists. Hence, possible risks and adverse impacts of the project activities on women will be identified to ensure gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment. UN-Habitat has undertaken detailed stakeholder mapping, including the identification of specific needs, limitations, constraints, and requirements of women. The interventions will ensure that both gender groups will benefit from the outcomes of the project by enhancing their involvement in activities.   Last but not least, municipal and public entity representatives of both genders will be involved in this project. Involving representatives from both gender groups effectively contributes to increasing the overall participation and responsiveness of the community. For instance, a high visibility of female representative leading the project will become a key to encourage more women and girls from the local community to participate and foster a sense-of-belonging for women while participating in the project activities, which contribute to increase gender mainstreaming in the targeted area.  Organized tours will be conducted, targeting representatives from other municipalities, local communities, school students, and non-governmental organizations active in the water and energy sectors. These tours will create awareness among various stakeholders and the general community about the innovative interventions implemented in the project, promoting best practices in sustainable water management and non-conventional nature-based solutions. The outcome of these dissemination efforts will be an informed and engaged community, with increased understanding and appreciation for the project‚Äôs impact on water resilience and sustainable water management practices. To ensure that both girls and boys have equal exposure to these knowledge exchange workshops and tours, gender balance will be actively tracked and monitored to promote gender equality as a way to equal representation from both genders.""",1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights,-,"Based on the current suboptimal situation of the water and wastewater sectors in Lebanon and Jordan, basic human rights are put at risk such as the right to access clean water for domestic and irrigation purposes, to be serviced by adequate wastewater treatment infrastructure and to have access to green recreational spaces. Hence, the project activities will help in satisfying basic human rights rather than jeopardizing them by providing alternative sources of domestic and irrigation water in Lebanon and Jordan which are more sustainable than conventional sources, providing renewable solar energy to complement conventional energy sources used at the Zahle wastewater treatment plant, providing additional wastewater treatment through lagoon construction at the Jerash wastewater treatment plant, and promoting the greening of Zahle District. This project needs to ensure that all groups have equal access to water resources and infrastructures. However, considering the limited budget and resources provided, realistic planning and assessment need to be conducted to ensure the targeted areas, where vulnerable groups are concentrated, can gain a high-level accessibility of clean water. To leave no one behind, UN-Habitat and the project stakeholders are responsible for increasing community awareness of one‚Äôs rights to have access to such necessities as clean water. In addition, grievance options need to be explained to the community to help them understand that one has the right to raise a voice for a change regardless of one‚Äôs age, race, gender, and status. Any possibilities that may hinder one from accessing the grievance option such as disability, lack of access to digital devices, language barrier, cultural beliefs and other obstacles must be considered in advance.

The Adaptation Communication, submitted as part of the updated NDC resonates strongly with the findings of NAP process consultations held in 2017 by the government and the Third National Communication (NC). The Ministry of Environment (MoE) started a national dialogue for developing a national adaptation framework in 2017 to address adaptation in a comprehensive, coherent, and strategic manner and to increase resilience in vulnerable communities. This is because adaptation plans and strategies that have been developed previously in Lebanon by various entities are sector-specific, scattered and lack integration. Based on this, MoE aims to develop a medium and long-term approach to reducing the country‚Äôs vulnerability to climate impacts, facilitate the integration of climate adaptation into on-going planning processes while optimizing the use of existing plans in preparing the ground for the preparation of Lebanon‚Äôs National Adaptation Plan (NAP).
The project‚Äôs overall objective is to support the Government of Lebanon in strengthening the NAP process and increasing the resilience of water resource planning in urban areas in Lebanon. The project aims at addressing the existing barriers including: i) Limited mainstreaming of CCA into national and local planning and budgeting; ii) Weak institutional and technical capacity and staffing in sectoral Ministries, iii) Lack of reliable data and climate change related information on water resources for municipal use; and iv) Limited implementation of existing action plans for water.  
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as the Delivery Partner (DP), will implement the project in close coordination with MoE, MoEW, the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM), the Meteorological Office, the Ministry of Public works and Transport, the Ministry of Industry, as well as the Council for Development and Reconstruction which acts as the primary land planning entity in Lebanon. In addition, the project will coordinate with UN-Habitat, UNICEF, Global Water Partnership-MED and other national and international partners active in the field and the selected locations.
The project will directly benefit the communities and local authorities of the City of Tyre and the Nahr-el Kalb Watershed, with a rebound effect across other coastal cities and watersheds. In addition, by strengthening coordination mechanisms, information sharing, institutional arrangements, and capacity building, the government and the climate change community will benefit from this integrated NAP project.""

This initiative seeks to alleviate resource strain and mitigate rising tensions among different community groups. It will be achieved through a comprehensive, integrated approach that effectively addresses specific needs while simultaneously empowering community factions to tackle mounting challenges in a way that's environmentally sustainable.

The envisioned intervention entails the development of urban farming skills for both women and youth. It also includes supplying clean water and renewable energy to key public facilities such as schools and a health dispensary. Concurrently, the project will raise community awareness regarding cholera prevention. By putting acquired skills and knowledge into practice, the project aims to enhance food security, promote hygiene, and improve sanitation conditions for vulnerable populations, including both locals and refugees residing in the Shalfeh neighborhood.

Furthermore, the interventions will play a pivotal role in heightening climate change awareness. They will introduce uncomplicated yet impactful behavioral changes aimed at fostering nature-based solutions at the urban level.

It's important to highlight that the proposed project is designed to complement the ongoing initiatives spearheaded by UN-Habitat, UN-Women, and UNICEF in Shalfeh. These initiatives are part of a project funded through the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security (UNTFHS). While the current project focuses on revamping a versatile community center to provide social and protective services primarily for vulnerable groups like women and youth, the new project will take the lead in addressing urgent basic necessities and pressing community needs.
