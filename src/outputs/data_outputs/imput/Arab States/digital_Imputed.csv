However, cooling also generates a serious carbon footprint, directly through the emissions of greenhouse gas refrigerants and indirectly due to the consumption of electricity generated using fossil fuels. Cooling is currently estimated to consume almost 20 percent of the world‚Äôs electricity consumption in buildings. Energy demand for space cooling is expected to triple by 2050 fueled by rising temperatures and economic prosperity. If cooling efficiency is not improved significantly, an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption and refrigerants will occur and warm the planet.
Digital tools and Internet of Things (IoT) provide valuable insights, automation, and control capabilities that can significantly enhance the energy efficiency of cooling systems, reducing emission of green-house gases, and identifying energy saving opportunities. By implementing smart cooling strategies and smart cold chain infrastructure, a city can reduce the urban heat island effect, minimize the amount of electricity consumed, which in turn reduces the use of fossil fuels and pressure on the power grid in the peak time.
Despite refrigeration and air conditioning accounting for a significant share of global energy consumption, the application of digitalization to these areas has so far received less attention than for other household appliances and mobility devices. Therefore, it is important to conduct demonstration projects to accumulate experiences for replication in more countries.
This project will research and identify digital tools which can be used to monitor the use of energy. Based on this information, it will pilot the use of such digital tools for the monitoring and development of strategies to minimize energy use.""
