In 2021, FAO provided technical assistance to the Ministry of works, Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning in formulating the National Food Security Strategy 2020 ‚Äì 2030 in Bahrain. The formulation engaged a wide range of stakeholders in close coordination by the Steering Committee headed by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Resources. The preparation of the Strategy was supported by the Technical Taskforce established by government, consisting of representatives from the government and civil society institutions. The strategy recommends on some core components for food security, notably it has targeted local food production system, investment, trade, national strategic reserve management, food waste, nutrition and food safety, as well as cross-cutting issues related to data and information systems, climate change  natural resource management and sustainability. 

Develop / strengthen the food and agricultural statistics system of Bahrain, with a focus on crops and livestock 

Following consultations with stakeholders, the assessment of the agricultural statistics system has been prepared. This has served to complete the draft Strategic Plan for Agriculture Statistics (SPAS), which provides the framework for the development of the Statistical System over the next five years. FAO assisted in developing the Bahrain Agriculture Survey methodology (questionnaire, manuals and methodological documents) and discussed with the Bahrain Technical Team and submitted to government. FAO provided the needed survey tools, which contribute to developing capacity of national staff to independently implement the survey, process, analyze and publish data.  

Strengthen sustainable development of the aquaculture sector 

In 2021, the within the frame of the ‚ÄúSupporting the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector in Bahrain‚Äù FAO implemented several activities, including conducted a) design of a new hatchery to accommodate the production objectives of the government; b) study on the best options for phytoplankton production in the hatchery for the feeding of the fish larvae; c) biosecurity risk assessment and development of Standard Operating Procedures for the National Mariculture Centre; and d) procurement of modern equipment. The projects provide support to the National Mariculture Centre of Ras Hayan for improving broodstock management and hatchery facilities, diversifying aquaculture products and delivering targeted training 

Develop and implement a national scheme to eradicate animal diseases and zoonosis 

Stakeholder consultation has led the establishment of a taskforce representing various ministries led by the Ministry of Works, Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning. In 2021, FAO in collaboration with the ministry has conducted surveillances to eradicate zoonotic diseases (brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR), one of the transboundary animal diseases. Serological results for brucellosis indicate that except for isolated farm, which turned positive for antibodies due to vaccination history, the disease was not found in the flocks. Serological evidence show that PPR, which never been reported in the Kingdom, has a quarter of its sheep and goats with positive antibodies. This may be attributed to vaccinating of animals with smuggled vaccines or mixing of imported animals, which were vaccinated abroad. FAO has prepared PPR Contingency/Emergency Plan for the Kingdom in order to apply for recognition of its status by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). FAO has also supported on the Bahrain‚Äôs diagnostic system, surveillance system, prevention and control system, legal framework and stakeholder involvement. 

Preliminary results of mass testing of cattle using interferon gamma assays (IGRA) revealed that over 40% (of 3856 tested) were positive. The re-testing of the positive ones with tuberculin PPD (skin test) is showing over 80% agreement with IGRA signifying the number of animals to be culled with compensation. The Kingdom has 7,880 heads of cattle and a conservative estimate for positivity would mean that at least 2,733 would be culled. Given that some animals would still be missed, we have a plan to use Ab-ELISA test to get animals with latent infection (chronically infected with advanced bovine TB). As the screening is ongoing, FAO is requesting additional compensation fund to compensate affected farmers in order to begin the culling of positive reactors to ensure the eradication.  

Prevent potential pandemics through strengthening the implementation of biosecurity improvement for emerging and re-emerging transboundary threats on food and agriculture sectors
