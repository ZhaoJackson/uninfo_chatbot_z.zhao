The initiative continues to actively engage the six inter-agency working groups in Bahrain (established by the Ministry of Justice via Ministerial Order No. 45 of 2017) to further develop and deliver contextualized training programmes that align with international conventions, standards and norms in areas including anti-corruption, economic and financial crimes (including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing), cybercrime, trafficking in persons, justice for children, alternatives to imprisonment, and victim protection (including addressing violence against women and children). By increasing skill and competency levels across these topics, the sub-output ensures that Bahrain‚Äôs police, prosecutors, and judges are better equipped to apply international best practices within the local legal framework, including by advancing a victim-centred approach. The sub-ouput also relies on the collaboration with Bahrain‚Äôs Regional Centre of Excellence on Trafficking in Persons to further a victim-centred approach to combating trafficking in persons, including by expanding its training resources and making sure they are anchored in international legal standards. Lastly, the sub-output supports the alignment of crime prevention and criminal justice data/statistics with international standards, which will help better inform related policies and strategies as well as monitor progress on SDG targets related to public security and justice.
