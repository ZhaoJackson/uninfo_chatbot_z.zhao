The lack of access to modern and reliable energy services, resulted in a negative impact throughout all sectors in Lebanon. Energy provides services to meet many basic human needs, particularly heat, motive power, and light. Without adequate power, education facilities, amongst others, cannot properly provide any of their services. Most facilities are resorting to running diesel generators at excessive costs to ensure business continuity and this is further constraining their already scarce financial resources. Initiatives that thus assist the education sector in freeing income for backstopping services in a budget-constrained environment, such as the services of energy provision, will provide more resilience in the provision of education.
The objective of solarization of the targeted schools is to assist the Lebanese public education institutions to become more cost-effective, more comfort-related, environmentally responsible, and actively engaged in the transition towards a more sustainable energy future. The intervention will also reduce the cost of electricity paid by the school where savings can be used for other urgent needs in addition to ensuring a secure and sustainable source of electricity given the increasing electricity outage hours and high diesel prices after the subside removal. This project will also reduce the amount of fuel imported and burnt hence avoiding greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) emissions.""
