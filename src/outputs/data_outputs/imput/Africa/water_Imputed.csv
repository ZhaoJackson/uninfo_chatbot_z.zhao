The development of IMISET was preceded by a number of activities, including the determination of national irrigation indicators, the identification of the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in data management, and the development of a methodology for data collection and analysis. Output 2 concerned the capacity-building of government staff in the use of IMISET and in irrigation water management. A total of 428 experts received training in data collection and entry in IMISET, and in IMISET algorithm and computation of indicators, while 238 federal and regional experts were trained in improved water management. Guidelines for data collection and entry in IMISET were prepared, and equipment provided for these activities and for improved farm water management practices. The final output regarded the collection of irrigation data and their entry in IMISET. This output was partially achieved. Irrigation data were collected from 158 irrigation schemes (against an envisaged target of 125) in five regions, but the data were not entered in IMISET as a result of challenges face by MoA in creating user accounts. When fully operational, IMISET will enable the Government to monitor the performance and status of irrigation systems, alert decision-makers and other relevant actors to take appropriate measures for low-performing and non-functional irrigation systems, establish a benchmark for research to improve irrigation performance, assess the contribution of irrigated agriculture to Gross Domestic Product, and estimate the number of permanent and temporary jobs created in the irrigation subsector.",248500.0,223924.31,194208.67,-,248500.0,201347.94,148002.54,-,248500.0,212418.81,179834.31,-,248500.0,204012.83,173736.23,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Two major milestones this year were the ‚Äòfirst stone‚Äô ceremony for the Murrupula town centralized water supply system in Nampula and the handover of 21 solar-powered water system reinforcing UNICEF‚Äôs experience in resilient water infrastructures. More efforts are needed to continue piloting management modalities that ensure sustainability.Ôªøn 2022, 126,255 people had access to improved durable water (Basic + or above service level) with UNICEF support which represents 153 per cent of the expected target. This over-achievement could be attributed to durable water supply solutions implemented in humanitarian contexts: 94,399 additional people counting for 75 per cent of the total not included in the initial planning. As planned, 90 per cent (113,279) of this total was achieved in rural areas where water services coverage is 4.5 times less than in urban contexts. Main water supply interventions involved construction and/or rehabilitation of boreholes equipped with handpumps (273 in total), followed by multi-use solar-powered water supply systems (21), small water supply systems built as extensions of centralized systems (two) in six provinces: Sofala, Manica,Tete, Zambezia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado. In addition, 2,595 new households were connected to six water supply systems built with UNICEF Mozambique support in Inhambane province and for which new connections are attributed to UNICEF‚Äôs support during post-investment 10 years period. Finally, through UNICEF‚Äôs contribution to National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme (PRONASAR) Common Fund, 588 additional people also gained access to improved durable water. In urban contexts, the implementation of the Accelerating Sanitation and Water for All programme made a big step with the initiation of works for the centralized water system in Murrupula town in Nampula province. In support to the innovative/blended financing initiative to increase water access in small towns, UNICEF completed the feasibility studies for 35 small-towns water systems that might be funded using this scheme. Besides, UNICEF Mozambique supported scaling up the revolving fund approach to increase the number of household connections in small towns, in coordination with the USAID-funded initiative WASH Transform and the Dutch-funded initiative PO75. The main challenges faced during the implementation of water supply interventions were linked to the limited capacity government decentralized structures at provincial and district level negatively impacting timely completion of procurement processes and supervision. In the case of Cabo Delgado, in addition to it, the deterioration of the security situation continued to be a challenge, resulting in frequent interruption of construction works. Limited technical and mobilizing capacity of private contractors, such as lack of sufficient trained staff, cash flow and required equipment, also constrained the completion of some planned interventions. UNICEF‚Äôs technical assistance and continuous capacity building activities were crucial to overcome these challenges.  In terms of sustainability, the first nationwide sustainability check for rural WASH infrastructures was finalized and indicated a medium score of 66.1 for the country. Technical factors such as lack of post-construction services provided by Planning and Infrastructures District Services (SDPI), the absence of a mechanism to report breakdowns or supply chain and warehouse for spare parts were pointed out proving the necessity of exploring new management modalities and providing stronger support to community and private operators. ",4473836.0,3019438.78,2417911.59,"Improved, resilient, safe, and sustainably managed water services were particularly relevant in 2023 due to the cholera outbreak and Freddy cyclone (February-March 2023) where water services in urban and rural contexts were damaged putting burden on health for children and their caretakers to recover from cholera and other water linked disease.The regular programme made steady progress to increase access to water services, reaching 40,448 people during the year through the construction of 18 solar water supply systems and 14 boreholes with handpump in rural area. In urban context, the Murrupula small town water supply system was finalized as part of the ASWA II programme for Mozambique, providing access to a basic+ or safely managed water supply services for 13,500 people. This number will progressively increase in the coming years as household connections will be further rolled-out through the revolving fund mechanism. The revolving fund mechanism was also structurally supported by UNICEF, whereby 2,397 additional household connections (10,563 people) were installed in 14 small towns countrywide, where UNICEF share was 17% (408 households, 1,796 people). During 2023, 651 households (2,864 people) obtained access to a safely managed water supply service in the small towns where UNICEF invested in former years.Humanitarian activities added 231,639 people with (restored) access to water through durable solution in emergency; a significant effort, was done for the rehabilitation and disinfection of 586 boreholes and wells with handpump, after flooding and contamination that occurred due to the Freddy cyclone impact. Those interventions were designed with a ‚Äúbuilding back better‚Äù approach, to make them resilient for future climatological events. In the humanitarian context of the Cabo Delgado crisis, small town (urban) systems rehabilitation and extension in Cabo Delgado were completed reaching 62,606 people from IDP and host communities.To respond to the challenges of the hydrogeological complexity, a hydrogeological study including geophysical survey was completed in 15 critical communities in the district of Nacala a Velha. A similar study is also underway in 30 communities in the Memba district with the aim of locating potential sites for boreholes drilling for water supply. Also, to respond to the challenge of quality control in the borehole drilling for water supply, a drilling training was carried out in Cabo Delgado province and was attended by 40 trainees from government and private sector contractors, jointly facilitated by UNICEF and SDC. This training module will also be replicated in other provinces in collaboration with other WASH partners. To reinforce the capacity of the provinces in quality control, in addition to the training mentioned above, UNICEF acquired equipment (borehole camera, depth meter, water quality analysis kits) to be allocated in each of the 4 priority provinces (Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia and Sofala), where training sessions are also planned for the correct use of the equipment.Between the main challenges are the capacity of government partners to absorb the needs for programme design and tendering, and also the limited capacities of the private sector for the implementation of quality infrastructures.",3973502.0,2853970.44,2711271.91,-,3973502.0,3576365.48,2830688.42,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

According to a report from UNESCO, the City Blueprint is of utmost importance as extreme weather events can leave city streets underwater in no time or protracted drought which renders a city‚Äôs water supply incapable of meeting its needs. Scientific reports have shown that Climate change, urbanization, water pollution, and inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures in cities may lead to flooding, water scarcity, adverse health effects, and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. Furthermore, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is hindered by water governance gaps and a lack of data. There is, therefore, the need to have a standardized indicator framework for urban Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and the City Blueprint Framework (CBF) Approach provides this framework as well as enhances the transition towards water-wise cities, by city-to-city learning.UNESCO has been working with relevant authorities to implement the CBF approach to help countries, including Nigeria, to achieve water security. During the first phase of the work, UNESCO Abuja office joined efforts with the Regional Center for Integrated River Basin Management (RC-IRBM) Kaduna to implement CBF in Abuja and Lagos. There is now a need to cover cities in Nigeria and this will require young water professionals who are knowledgeable in applying the tool. It is in that vein, UNESCO has joined efforts with the Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC), to organize the training of City Blueprint Framework (CBF) for Urban Water Management held on Thursday 17th August 2023, at Rockview Royale Hotel, Abuja, Nigeria. The training had the following objectives: Strengthen the Capacity of technical officers of the Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC) to implement the City Blueprint Framework (CBF) approach; for urban water management.  Adopt a project concept focused on CBF, for possible fund mobilization.  The 50 Participants at the training included staff of the Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC), Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), Abuja Environmental Development Board (AEPB), Federal Capital Territory Water Board (FCTWB), National Water Resources Institute (NWRI), the Regional Centre for Integrated River Basin Management Commission (RC-IRBM), Nigerian National Commission for UNESCO (Natcom-UNESCO) and UNESCO Abuja Office.  Result of the training activity included the following Participants received information and were sensitized on the City Blueprint Framework approach. The Capacity of young technical officers of the Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC) and some relevant stakeholders in FCT, strengthened on the implementation of City Blueprint Framework (CBF) approach; for urban water management. Training Materials developed for City Blueprint Framework (CBF) approach. A draft project proposal on ‚ÄúCity Blueprint Framework (CBF) Approach for Sustainable Water Management in Nigerian Cities‚Äù was discussed and adopted by experts and stakeholders present. The proposal will be fully developed for fund mobilization  ",5000.0,3941.77,3327.69,"Groundwater is widely used in Nigeria because it brings large economic benefits per unit volume, it is locally available, drought resilient and has quality requiring minimal treatment. The reliability of supply of groundwater, uniform quality and temperature, relatively good turbidity and pollution free, minimal evaporation losses, and low cost of development are attributes which make groundwater more attractive when compared to other sources. Therefore, there is the need to assess this important resource with a view of providing the necessary scientific information for policy and discission making, planning and sustainable management.  In 2024 two workshops was implemented within the framework of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Hydrology programme to elaborate the following studies 1)     Groundwater Quality Assessment - building from the City Blueprint Framework; to enhance water security in the country and contribute to the Renewed hope Agenda (RHA). Studies will focus on problem of Pollution from Biological (mostly from septic tank and fecal matter from open defecation) and other pollutants. Studies have commenced with an inception phase.  2)     Groundwater Resources Assessments and Sustainable Management for Climate Resilience and Food Security in Nigeria ‚Äì reviewed for fund mobilization 3)     Restoration of Degraded Wetlands in part of Benue Basin for Enhanced Water Management and Food Production - reviewed for fund mobilizationResult will inform policy and strengthen Groundwater governance also contributing to SDG targets 1.5, 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2, 6.B. 11.5. 11.6, 13.1, 13.2 ",5500.0,4382.52,3520.53,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Unfortunately, since the groundwater is a hidden source, less attention is given to its adequate governance, investments in infrastructure, trained professionals, and knowledge. There is also the problem of Inadequate data and information for robust policy and proper planning that interlinks groundwater with sustainable development factors like climate change adaptation, education, health, wealth creation and gender-mainstreaming. To this end UNESCO Abuja joined efforts with the National Water Resources Institute (NWRI), Kaduna, Nigeria, to implement the Sub-project ‚ÄúImproving Groundwater Governance towards achieving Sustainable Water Security for Human Settlements in Nigeria‚Äù. The Sub-Project is being implemented within the framework of UNESCO/Korean Fund in Trust (K-FIT) Project tilted ‚ÄúWater Security for Human Settlements in Developing Countries under Climate Change‚Äù, The Sub-project has the overall objective of improving knowledge-based management and governance of groundwater resources to support Nigeria in achieving sustainable water security for human settlements as well as build resilience to the impact of climate change in Nigeria.

Three (3) coordination meetings around IWRM and Water Governance. These include:-   The launching of the Water Sector Coordination Facility in September 2022 by the MOEWR.-   The high-level Water Sector Development Forum in March 2023.-   The Integrated Water Sector Development Task Force Meeting in May 2023.A total of 210 people (30% women) have been sensitized through these meetings on IWRM and Water Governance. The coordination meetings have also enabled to gain traction by the political leadership for a comprehensive approach for water governance and IWRM in the changing climatic conditions.The coordination meetings have also enabled to gain traction by the political leadership for a comprehensive approach for water governance and IWRM in the changing climatic conditions.The project was successful in developing a gender-sensitive National IWRM Strategy, accompanied by an implementation roadmap and strategic results framework through a multi-stakeholder consultative process.The National Water Coordination Facility has been established in line with the recommendation of National Water Resources Strategy (NWRS, 2021-25). The facility has five sub-working groups co-chaired by the government and relevant UN agencies including UNDP, FAO, UNEP, UNICEF.. Furthermore, concept note for allocation of resources from Somalia Joint Fund (SJF) to support Water Governance has been drafted by UNDP and MOEWR.National Water Management Task Force has been established to coordinate Flood, emergency relief, and Integrated Water Resource Management interventions. This initiative will strengthen the overall frameworks for flood, emergency and Integrated water Resource Management interventions through appropriate coordination and facilitation platforms complimented by a clear financing framework.In response to the need for improved water management in the riverine areas, a comprehensive study for Basin Diagnostic and Strategic Action Plan has been finalised for the Shabelle River through a consultative process engaging a diverse set of stakeholders from key line ministries at the Federal and Member States, researchers, academia and development partners. In addition, MOEWR with support of GEF-LDCF project, has finalised the 5-year Strategic Action Plan, to address the issues and challenges pertaining to water governance, flooding, irrigation and in-country  transboundary river basin management in a changing climatic conditions.A similar comprehensive study for the Basin Diagnostic and Strategic Action Plan for the Juba Basin along with the preparation of prioritized project is also on-going, in partnership with the World Bank funded Somalia Crisis Recovery Project (SCRP). One of the recommendations of the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) for Shabelle River is the establishment of the Shabelle River Basin Management Authority for the operations of the barrages and water allocations for various water user groups. A hydro-climatic modelling study was completed to inform the Strategic Action Plan for Juba River Basin (note: the study is available with the MOEWR).With the aim of assessing the groundwater potential in the river basins, LDCF-GEF project has supported the MOEWR to partner with Intergovernmental Agency for Development (IGAD) to undertake the Merti Aquifer Feasibility Study. The aquifer is shared between Somalia and Kenya, and the study will enable the two countries to assess the potential of conjunctive use of groundwater resources with the surface water. In addition, the project was also seen to undertake capacity-building training on IWRM for multi-sectoral stakeholders at the Federal level and the Federal Member States. Also,, the project was also successful in developing and implementing an IWRM Master‚Äôs Degree Programme at the Somalia National University. Thirty (35 ) students (30% female). This initiative will support sustainable water resource management, long-term adaptation to climate change and capacity building of young professionals to implement water  climate initiatives in future.The IWRM LDCF-GEF project supported the establishment of the curricula for TVET with water management focus. Needs assessment for the existing vocational training centers/Institutions have been completed by the MOEWR in consultations with the relevant institutions and actors at the Federal and Federal Members States. An agreement has been signed with IHE Delft Institute for Water Education by MoEWR-FGS to implement the recommendations of the needs assessments in the Agriculture, Water, Livestock and Disaster Risk Management sectors and meet the project end target. UNESCO¬¥s International Hydrological Programme (IHP) is the only intergovernmental freshwater initiative institutionalized in the UN system supporting Water Governance.Water quality laboratories assessment has been completed by the Federal Ministry of Energy and Water Resources for Puntland, Galmudug, Southwest, Hirshabelle and Jubaland States.

For each of the eleven water supply systems, UNICEF, in collaboration with the relevant ministries (Ministry of Water Resources and Sanitation, and the Ministry of Health), Partner Organisations (CSO and INGO), and the right holders, developed a water safety plan, ensure water is safe from source to point of consumption. UNICEF also facilitated the capacity building of WASHCOMS in over 500 communities through training and the provision of toolkits for the sustainability of completed facilities.  In addition, UNICEF significantly contributed to elevating the learning and quality of care services within schools and health facilities through the provision of water supply services in 13 schools and 11 healthcare facilities. Through the intervention in schools, 8,851 children (4,514 boys; 4,337 girls) have gained access to and utilize basic basic water supply services.

Climate-resilient WASH systems provided safe water to 197,000 people, while community-led sanitation efforts declared 217 villages open defecation-free, benefiting over 54,250 individuals. Participatory approaches engaged 700 water point committees to sustain WASH infrastructure, supported by community dialogues promoting hygiene and sanitation practices.In response to disasters like Cyclone Freddy, UNICEF partnered with local institutions to deliver mental health and psychosocial support, community policing, and case management services, reaching 600,000 children and caregivers. Nutrition interventions included mobilizing 1,675 care groups to educate caregivers on optimal child feeding practices, contributing to the treatment of 40,811 children with severe wasting.UNICEF integrated climate-smart agricultural practices into livelihood programs, training over 25,840 individuals in financial literacy, business management, and sustainable farming. Collaborations with schools and community networks promoted resilience through health, SRHR, and nutrition education.Through participatory dialogue and multi-sectoral approaches, these interventions built community capacity to adapt to climate challenges, ensuring sustained access to critical services, improved health outcomes, and stronger resilience against future shocks.Challenges: UNICEF faces challenges in sustaining WASH systems, maintaining community engagement, and responding effectively to disasters. Cultural stigmas around mental health and economic viability issues also pose obstacles. Opportunities/ Priorities: However, opportunities exist in empowering communities through local initiatives, scaling successful interventions, and fostering partnerships for innovative solutions. Continuous dialogues can enhance awareness of health and nutrition, while climate-smart practices improve agricultural sustainability. Engaging youth can cultivate future leaders capable of addressing climate challenges. UNHCR: UNHCR contributed to building resilience of refugees and the host community in Malawi by expanding coverage of parametric insurance in Malawi through ARC replica programme. Through this UNHCR paid a premium of USD 250,000 which resulted into the payout of USD 400,000 which was used to compensate 4000 HHs that were affected by El Nino in Dzaleka camp and the host community.",7450000.0,6179144.89,5304486.86,WHO: Provided technical support for risk communication and community engagement. ,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

As part of ensuring continuity of water supply during the COVID-19 pandemic, water treatment chemicals were provided to ensure safe water to an estimated 600,000 people connected to the South Sudan Urban Water Corporation = water network in Juba, Wau, and Bor.  UNICEF continued supplying water to the urban areas of Malakal and parts of Jonglei and Upper Nile State through emergency SWATs.
The programme responded to the food and malnutrition crisis and targeted the ten priority counties for provision of WASH in nutrition centres and communities with high GAM levels. In addition to the development program support to health facilities this strategy resulted in more than 171% over-achievement of the targeted support to health facilities (90 supported with WASH facilities against the target of 67).  Additionally UNICEF provided WASH facilities in 87 schools.

IOM: IOM constructed a number of new water sources as part of its response to the WASH needs of urban/rural host communities, as well as those internally displaced by conflict, flooding and/or high levels of food insecurity (31 mechanically drilled boreholes, 26 manually drilled boreholes, 118 borehole rehabilitations, 9 Solarized Water Yards, and 2 SWAT systems). IOM also continued to ensure daily water service provision of IDPs living in Bentiu, Wau and Malakal IDP/PoC camps, by managing, operating and maintaining 2 large-scale water distribution systems (one covering Wau IDP camp and another covering S2 &S3 of Bentiu IDP camp), as well as a large-scale SWAT system in Malakal PoC - all of which hybrid systems (operating both with solar, as well as diesel). As part of its support to other WASH partners operating in Bentiu IDP Camp, IOM also re-activated its Contingency Borehole system whenever needed, providing additional support to Mercy Corps (operating in Sector 1) during 2021. During the last quarter of the year, IOM's water supply system in Wau IDP Camp was entirely solar powered  - reflecting IOM's commitment to transition to a more green approach to WASH service delivery in an emergency context. Access to safe drinking water was also further enhanced through  IOM's WASH Emergency, Preparedness & Response distribution program, whereby WASH NFI Kits containing water treatment products were distributed to a number of IDPs experiencing a range of crisis (31,023 WASH NFI kits, 938 SAM/MAM WASH NFI Kits, 1,500 COVID-19 WASH NFI Kits and 412 HEV-E dedicated WASH NFI Kits). IOM also supported the national C-19 Preparedness & Response Plan by installing and operating 666 handwashing devices in key hotspot areas, whilst supporting 8 Health Facilities and 3 PoEs with IPC/WASH.

As a result, about 8,936,000 people are living in open defecation free environments. Access to affordable durable sanitation products remains a challenge for the rural communities on account of affordability and access to financing. UNICEF continued support for smart subsidies to reach the most vulnerable population (those exempted from paying health insurance and those under the urban or rural productive safety net programme). In Addis Ababa sub-cities, WASH and Social Policy targeted selected households under the urban productive safety net programme to improve shared latrines by retrofitting SATO pans. These toilets are popular, and the users are proudly taking care of them. Four households share a toilet.A market-based sanitation approach is gaining ground, with undoubted demand for durable latrine products, but supply chain constraints are still an issue. Landed costs for imported sanitation products are beyond households without savings or micro-financing. Farming communities prefer seasonal lump sum payments. An evolving microfinancing approach addresses the needs of the middle pyramid population. Microfinancing models on the market in Ethiopia have demonstrated that farming households can repay microfinancing loans for durable toilet products in two lump sum payments including interest. UNICEF is developing partnerships for the microfinancing approach. This year, the support has been through supporting a scaling up of a model developed by FINISH Mondial consortium. The WASH Financing Strategy validation workshop registered interest from key stakeholders led by the Ministry of Finance to review and refine recommendation for enabling private financing to water, sanitation, and hygiene. Up to 15 Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) are already lending to the water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Stakeholders have recommended government to consider a statutory proportion of loan financing for the sector as has for agriculture sector.  Some commercial banks are showing interest to consider or expand lending for water, sanitation, and hygiene. Some manufacturers have explored options for local manufacturing of their range of toilet products but are constrained with financial regulations and conditions for transfer of Molds. TSEDU National mobile application, targeting various groups such as religious leaders, HEWs, students, journalists, media practitioners, and the wider community is finalized. The app incorporates inclusive features like audio and sign language options for people with disabilities. Virtual Reality project utilizes virtual reality as a tool to educate school-age children about important WASH behaviors. The immersive experience offered by VR enhances learning and engagement, allowing children to interact with virtual scenarios and simulations. This creates a more impactful and memorable educational experience, effectively conveying key WASH practices such as hand hygiene, menstrual hygiene, improved toilet utilization, safe water management, and safe disposal of child faces.

The knowledge acquired by district personnel will ensure effective guidance to the district leaders and ASPs in the roll out of the revised OM framework.In 2020, the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) received support to review the operationalization of the national Operation and Maintenance (OM) framework. The review aimed at enhancing the formation of community structures, identification of Area Service Providers (ASPs), and assessing district authorities' achievements in implementing the OM framework efficiently. Concurrently, UNICEF, in collaboration with Water Missions, installed 10 remote sensing data loggers in Karamoja as part of climate resilience efforts. These loggers offer real-time data on static and dynamic water levels to monitor aquifer sustainability and water system functionality.The Ministry of Health (MoH) received assistance in developing a new National Sanitation Policy, involving stakeholder engagement and a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). Additionally, support was extended to MoH for creating manuals on case management and responding to waterborne disease outbreaks.UNICEF's interventions led to 123,293 people gaining access to basic sanitation services. Market-Based Sanitation initiatives were implemented to stimulate the private sector, generate demand for sanitation services, and enhance district capacities. In institutional Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), 48 schools (against a target of 45) and 9 health centers received appropriate facilities.Under Emergency WASH, UNICEF responded to public health crises, including Ebola, Marburg, Cholera outbreaks, flooding, and droughts.

Only in 2022, 23 healthcare facilities (121 per cent of the planned target) received a water, sanitation, waste management and hygiene services full package resulting in improved health services for at least 16,000 maternity inpatients. Likewise, 109 schools (206 per cent of the planned target) received a similar WASH infrastructures and hygiene promotion package benefitting at least 53,259 children with improved learning conditions.ÔªøWASH in institutions was created as a standalone output under the new CPD 2022-2026 to increase the visibility of the dire situation of water, sanitation, and hygiene in institutions, particularly in HCFs and schools. UNICEF Mozambique built on the experience and lessons learnt consolidated in previous years, as well as on UNICEF‚Äôs leadership role in Education, Health and Nutrition sectors, to continue positioning itself as a key partner for the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education to further strengthen enabling environment for implementation of WASH in HCFs and schools‚Äô programmes. In 2022, a total of 23 HCF, 4 of them in humanitarian contexts, received a full package of WASH infrastructures (solar powered water supply system, gender disaggregated and inclusive toilets, solid waste management system and kitchen/laundry blocks) which represents 121 per cent of the planned targets. This over-achievement was related to emergency intervention not included in initial planning. These interventions benefitted at least 16,000 mothers hospitalized in maternity wards (source: National Health Information System ‚Äì SISMA). On top of it, detailed designs and tender documents have been developed for 50 HCFs in Zambezia, Nampula and Niassa provinces. Since sustainability continue to be a major problem in this area, UNICEF Mozambique further supported capacity building activities and trained 129 health workers, from 30 facilities in Zambezia and Nampula provinces, to better operate and maintain WASH infrastructures and conduct hygiene promotion activities. In coordination with the MoH, UNICEF continued supporting the roll out of the WASH-FIT trainings (Facility Improvement Tool), a tool created to ensure regular evaluation and improvement of infectious diseases prevention and control in HCFs. This support is included in the roadmap developed by the WASH in HCFs multi-sectoral group to further strengthen enabling environment to achieve full WASH coverage in HCFs by 2030. Progresses in this area have been constrained by the limited capacity and competing priorities of MoH staff, as well as for lack of data for planning. At school level, 109 schools (206 per cent of the planned target) gained access to an improved water source, among which 20 got access to a full WASH package including basic sanitation and hygiene services. This translated into around 53,259 additional school children (25,610 girls and 27,649 boys) having access to at least basic water services at school. This over-achievement was related to increased awareness of communities about the importance of WASH in schools, particularly after COVID-19, triggering their decision of locating water points in neighboring schools, rather than in the communities.  As sustainability is also a major problem for schools, UNICEF Mozambique supported the establishment and training of water committees to manage water sources, with strong accent on gender balance. Menstrual hygiene management was also mainstreamed in all WASH in Schools interventions with a training package being delivered through school councils and PEC contractors as well as by ensuring that infrastructures built ensure the minimum required privacy.",5934000.0,3852708.67,3097284.23,"In 2023, 46 out of the 51 targeted HCFs, representing an achievement of 90%, benefited from a full WASH package that includes solar system providing running water at critical points of the health care facility, gender separated and inclusive toilets, as well as solid waste management systems. At least 36,000 maternity inpatients benefitted from these improved services and infrastructures (SISMA, 2023). In parallel, technical assessments and designs were developed for 89 HCFs and construction contracts were signed for 60 HCFs in 3 provinces. As part of capacity building activities, UNICEF trained 65 health workers and on operation, maintenance and an additional 88 health workers on WASHFIT. At school level, 71 schools located in rural areas, where the most needs are, gained access to improved water sources, representing an achievement of 103% of the annual target and translating into 42,600 additional school children reached and benefiting from a more conducive learning environment (19,170 girls and 23,430 boys). Out of these, 41 schools received a full WASH package, while 30 schools benefitted only from improved water services. Beyond infrastructures construction, UNICEF provided technical and financial support in all target schools to the establishment or revitalization of water committees which were trained on operation and maintenance. A strong gender lens was applied to all WASH interventions at school level, including a focus on menstrual hygiene management. In this area, an innovative approach, proposing a combination of awareness raising activities and distribution of reusable pads to schoolgirls, was developed in urban areas. As a result, a total of 1,300 schoolgirls received hygiene kits and 6,109 school children (3,057 boys and 3,052 girls) received information on menstruation to break myths and taboos. Learnings are being generated for use into future WinS Interventions.UNICEF also worked at upstream level to strengthen the enabling environment for WASH in Institutions. UNICEF used its convening power to support the development of a national advocacy agenda on WASH in HCFs and the establishment of sub-working groups led by the MoH. These sub-groups are supporting the finalization and approval of norms and standards for WASH in HCFs, as well as the creation of an effective operation and maintenance monitoring system. In this regard, steady progresses were made for the roll out of the WASHFIT tool, including the translation of the WASHFIT manual and training package into Portuguese, the establishment of an accreditation system certifying HCFs implementing WASHFIT, as well as the identification and empowerment of a national institution to deliver WASHFIT courses. For WASH in Schools, UNICEF continued supporting the Ministry of Education on the development of norms and standards for WASH in schools through an inclusive and nationwide consultation that will lead to more harmonized WASH support at school level among partners.",5944000.0,4474965.95,4251217.66,-,5944000.0,4770685.31,4020548.61,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

The only indicator that did not progress is the one related to disaster risk reduction given lack of funds for this activity, a situation that is now partially addressed and is expected to progress in 2023. Cabo Delgado conflict further deteriorated in the last months of 2022 with new Non-State Armed Group (NSAG) attacks resulting in new displacements - 940,000 Internally Displace Population (IDP)s (Displacement tracking Monitoring (DTM). Nov 2022) - that affected Cabo Delgado, Nampula and Niassa provinces. In this context only, UNICEF provided appropriate drinking water services to 251,815 people (60,337 with durable solutions). Water trucking was mainly used to supply water to at least 100,000IDPs living in temporary or resettlements sites where durable solutions were not feasible, or during construction works.99,018 people where reached with sanitation and hygiene services provided by UNICEF‚Äôs implementing partners, 85,730 of them with durable solutions. Temporary solutions were mainly used in temporary sites where at least 30 communal latrines were built and regularly dislodged by local services providers that ensured proper collection, transport, and disposal. In resettlement sites and host communities, UNICEF promoted the CLTS approach adapted to emergency context while, for more vulnerable households, UNICEF‚Äôs partners continued distributing slabs. Disability was mainstreamed with disability add-on products procured via UNICEF Supply Division‚Äôs and distributed to vulnerable people. Through at least 13 Joint Rapid Response, in coordination with WFP and IOM, a total of 186,935 people received critical WASH supplies. In less than 30 days (February ‚Äì March 2022), Mozambique was hit by two significant weather events - Tropical Storm Ana and Tropical Cyclone Gombe - affecting the same provinces: Nampula, Zambezia and Tete. In response to damages caused by these natural disasters, UNICEF quickly organized a response that included the rehabilitation of 95 boreholes equipped with handpumps,4 water supply systems (3 of them solar-powered) benefitting 52,079 people, distribution of critical WASH supplies, including hygiene kits and water purification items for 68,740 people. Cholera outbreaks were reported in 2022 in 4 districts of the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia and Niassa. UNICEF partnered with NGOs and provincial authorities to contain these outbreaks using Case Area Targeted Intervention (CATI) approach. Transmission-reducing interventions included active case-finding and referral to cholera treatment centers, as well as household-level WASH measures. In response to 1 Polio case confirmed in Tete province, UNICEF Mozambique quickly deployed a response using the same CATI approach resulting in 7 rehabilitated boreholes and the affected community certified as ODF. UNICEF Mozambique supported updating contingency plans in risk-prone provinces, as well as replenishment of contingency stocks as part of disaster preparedness activities for 2023 cyclone season. Five contingency partnerships were signed and activated at least 7 times during the year. Disaster risk reduction interventions are planned to 2023.",11165286.0,8067995.02,6031510.52,"In 2023, UNICEF responded to several humanitarian crisis, including those originated by armed conflicts, but also by natural disasters and public health emergencies. Although humanitarian WASH indicators did not meet the revised HAC targets, mainly due to a funding gap of around 85%, absolute numbers of beneficiaries for water supply increased 2.8 times; for sanitation, 4.6 times, and WASH supplies 5.5 times in comparison to 2022, which gives an indication of the huge scale and scope of the response. In total, 1,253,404 people were reached with appropriate drinking water services (51% of HAC target), of which 18% with durable solutions. 552,543 people were reached with appropriate sanitation (32% HAC target), of which about 68% gained basic and durable sanitation. Substantial WASH supplies were delivered benefitting 1,398,825 (109% of HAC target), including support to 73,363 women and girls with menstrual hygiene management materials. Additionally, 62 health care facilities were also supported with WASH Supplies.The conflict in Cabo Delgado, although lose some intensity, continued triggering displacement and, as of August 2023, around 627,846 people remained displaced, while 540,958 had returned to their homes. The sudden movements of people intensified pressure on the already limited WASH services. Only in this context, UNICEF and its partners provided emergency water supply to 127,400 IDP in temporary and resettlement sites through water trucking. Additionally, safe drinking water services was provided for 97,408 people, through durable solutions including construction and rehabilitation of water points and water networks. Appropriate sanitation was provided to 107,139 people using a mix of approaches including construction of emergency latrines, traditional latrines through provision of slabs and technical assistance.During the first quarter of 2023, Mozambique was affected by heavy rains that provoked floods in several locations and the tropical Cyclone Freddy that made landfall two times in central region. At least 184,000 people were forced to displace, and infrastructures and services, including water and sanitation, suffered huge damages. Simultaneously, a cholera outbreak, declared in September 2022 in Niassa province, expand to the whole country, affecting all 11 provinces and 76 out of the 161 districts, with 37,000 cases and 151 deaths (CFR - 0.4%), reported as of September 2023. A new counting then started on October 1st and, as of December 18th, 6,703 cases and 14 deaths, (CFR - 0.2%) had been reported in 25 districts. In this context, UNICEF deployed a massive emergency response that resulted in, 1,253,404 people being reached with appropriate drinking water services, of which 18% with durable solutions, most of them (95%) in rural areas. In total 586 water points were constructed or rehabilitated using the ‚ÄúBuilding back better‚Äù approach to ensure resilience. Additionally, 552,543 people were reached with appropriate sanitation services. Building on this experience, UNICEF further enhance its preparedness by training critical staff from the government, civil society and private sector on WASH in Emergency in all provinces and pre-positioning WASH critical supplies in UNICEF, but also partners, warehouses.
