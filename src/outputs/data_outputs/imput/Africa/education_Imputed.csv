First, STEM education seek to educate all young people to be scientifically and technologically literate citizens not only for the workforce of the 21st century but for them to lead useful lives in the emerging society; and second, STEM education will deliberately prepare those young people, who will become the scientists, technologists, engineers, medical personnel, and mathematicians of the future. Thus, STEM education is a critical driver of the technological and socio-economic progress of nations across the world. Fostering a strong foundation in STEM education is therefore essential for preparing the workforce of tomorrow. Nigeria needs to embrace STEM education/initiatives to address the country‚Äôs current challenges, leverage economic opportunities, and create jobs/industry to diversify the country‚Äôs economy. However, engaging students, particularly girls, in STEM fields is often hindered by a perceived difficulty stemming from ineffective teaching methods that fail to inspire excitement and practical application. Many schools are poorly equipped with science toolkits and laboratory materials that improve the effectiveness of teaching resulting in a general lack of interest in science subjects. To harness the full potential of STEM in teaching and learning, it is imperative to cultivate a strong foundation in STEM subjects through engaging students in practical instruction at early educational levels ‚Äîsuch as junior secondary and senior secondary schools which currently face persistent challenges. In view of the above justification, the UNESCO Abuja Office is implementing the activity ‚ÄúStrengthening STEM Education as Catalyst for Economic Diversification in Nigeria‚Äù with an aim of promoting the use of innovative STEM teaching and learning toolkits for chemistry, physics, biology, basic science and technology, mathematics, etc. thereby facilitating hands-on teaching and learning experiences. Additionally, the activity will introduce digital laboratories accessible through user-controlled animated interfaces on digital devices, as well as  promote robotics/AI, 3-d and other relevant techniques or teaching STEM  In 2023 UNESCO Abuja Office Abuja, implemented a sub-activity titled ‚ÄúTraining on Effective and Gender sensitive STEM and Basic Science education, through promotion of robotics/AI, 3-d and other relevant techniques.  Specific objective of the activity were the following;1.                 Strengthen Capacity building of STEM trainers on optimal approaches and mechanisms for improving STEM/basic science and engineering education.  2.

The training brought an updated learning approach to teachers, ensuring that they are equipped with valuable coding skills and exposed to modern technologies such as robotics, and machine learning. The overall objective of this training is to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to teach basic coding and provide an understanding of machine learning concepts using open-source tools such as Scratch, TinkerCard, TeachableMachine, etc. for incorporation into their teaching methodologies. Additionally, teachers were trained to deliver these lessons engagingly and interactively. Twenty-two (22) teachers from FCT ‚Äì Nigeria were equipped with the knowledge and skills to teach coding basics using Scratch to their students. The teachers who are also trainers, now have understanding of machine learning concepts through Teachable Machine to incorporate it into their teaching methodologies. They were also given robotic kits to effectively deliver coding and machine learning lessons engagingly and interactively, as well as foster creativity and critical thinking skills to inspire and guide their students in coding and machine learning projects.

Girls‚Äô education was strengthened through the dissemination of the VAC multisectoral mechanism in schools, the development of a school-based mentoring manual, and support to Circle of Interest school clubs, which benefited 69,400 students. The education system's capacity to provide inclusive education (IE) to children with disabilities was also strengthened through development of teacher-training manuals, training education professionals, and acquiring assistive technology for three inclusive resource centers.A total of 10,520 5‚Äì6-year-old children (50 per cent girls) benefitted from the Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) programme this year with UNICEF support. The programme prepares children for school, schools to receive children, and parents to support their children with learning and holistic development. ASR has a proven impact on enrollment rates: in Nampula, all 41 schools in the ASR programme surpassed their target for Grade 1 school enrolment, and 100 per cent of the children who participated in the ASR programme enrolled in Grade 1 in 2022 (against an enrollment rate of 70 per cent in the province).     Early Childhood Education (ECE) has also been strengthened through the development and finalization of Early Learning Development Standards (ELDS) for 0‚Äì6-year-old children and a Preschool Curriculum Framework for 0‚Äì5-year-old children. MINEDH and MGCAS found consensus on the content of the Manual for ECE subsystem governance while a preschool Working Group led by UNICEF was established this year. Strong collaboration with the national ECD network (RDPI) continued, resulting in 32 government and CSO stakeholders (19 women) strengthening their understanding of ECD service models and 45 RDPI members (28 women) with increased knowledge on how to ensure Protection Against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) through UNICEF-supported trainings.    The completion rate of primary education and lower secondary education improved in 2021 (latest data available). The rates are however still low: 49.6 per cent for primary education (51.4 per cent boys, 47.8 per cent girls) and 29.8 per cent for lower secondary education (30.2 per cent boys, 29.3 per cent girls). To improve completion rates, MINEDH has focused on girls‚Äô education and VAC in schools to ensure that children have a safe learning environment. MINEDH approved a life-skills guide for teachers and added content on Climate Change that will empower teachers and students with information and skills on how to organize extra-curricular activities. Through the Circle of Interest (CI) school clubs, 300 teacher mentors and more than 1,700 mobilizers of girls and boys (10-19 years old) increased their life skills, benefiting approximately 69,400 students in Nampula and Zambezia. MINEDH also developed a school-based mentoring manual that will contribute to girls remaining in school and transitioning from primary to secondary school. Efforts to improve the access and retention of children with disabilities and Special Educational Needs (SEN) have also been rolled out this year. There were 54,755 students with SEN in in primary education, representing 0.73 per cent of the student population. The capacity of education personnel to provide disability-inclusive education was strengthened through developing new teacher-training modules and training of 333 school directors (Nampula and Zambezia), 236 teachers (Nampula, Zamb√©zia and Cabo Delgado) and 14 IE focal points from province levels on inclusive methodologies, while 4 teachers from Cabo Delgado benefitted from an intensive 30-day course on sign language and Braille. Furthermore, three resource centers for inclusive education in Cabo Delgado and Nampula benefitted from acquisition of assistive technology, which will support children with disabilities in the region. ",2482439.0,2100186.04,1589703.27,"Early Childhood Education was strengthened through the approval of Early Learning Development Standards (ELDS) for 0‚Äì6-year-old children, a Preschool Curriculum Framework for 0‚Äì5-year-old children and inclusion of 1-year pre-primary education into a formal education system. Supporting the government on the development of the Early Childhood Education (ECE) strategy was initiated in 2023. Strong collaboration with the unique national ECD network ‚ÄúRede de Desenvolvimento da Primeira Infancia‚Äù continued, involving 51 relevant people including government entities (seven) and Civil Society Organization stakeholders (44) and 44 RDPI organization members (63 women). By engaging in the process, the mentioned entities, increased their understanding and knowledge about ECD services models including knowledge of how to ensure Protection Against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), and ECD in Emergency context. A total of 13,620 children between 5‚Äì6-year-old (50% and 5% Children with Disability) benefitted from the Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) programme which aims to prepare children for school and schools for children (to receive children and ensure their smooth transition into grade 1). It also empowers parents to support their children‚Äôs learning and holistic development processes. ASR has proven its impact on enrollment rate: in Nampula/Sofala/Zambezia provinces, 100 per cent of the children who participated in the ASR programme enrolled in Grade 1 in 2023.  While the completion rates of primary education and lower secondary education improved in 2022 (latest data available), the rates are still low: 56.8 per cent for primary education (grade 6 ‚Äì 2022) -(57.7 per cent for boys, 55.2 per cent for girls) and 29.3 per cent for lower secondary education (30.3 per cent for boys, 28.2 per cent for girls). To improve retention of students, particularly of girls, the Ministry of Education and Human Development (MINEDH) introduced a VAC referral mechanism in schools, ‚ÄúCirculos de Interesse‚Äù (school clubs and a mentoring system). A total of 645 (335 female) education personnel increased knowledge on implementation of life skills with UNICEF support. And a total of 3,607 students aged 10-19 years old (1,870 girls; 1,800 boys) from 600 schools were trained as mentors of school clubs on life skills, Menstrual Hygiene Management and VAC mechanism to become agents of change and support other peers in their schools and community reaching 180,350 (93,782 girls) students. As a result of the establishment of the VAC referral mechanism in schools, 1,272 (827 girls) cases were reported through different mechanisms established in UNICEF target schools in Nampula, Zambezia, and Sofala. MINEDH has developed a school-based mentoring manual, still in the final stages of approval by end of 2023, with UNICEF support. The manual, coupled with the associated mentoring activities, aims to facilitate a smooth transition for children, particularly girls, from primary to secondary schools within the Mozambican educational system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Efforts to strengthen Inclusive Education (IE) continued in 2023, contributing to improve access and retention of children with disabilities and Special Educational Needs (SEN) through training of teachers, including ‚ÄúInstituto de Forma√ß√£o de Professores‚Äô ‚Äù trainers and education officials, as well as the provision of assistive devices.",2309171.0,1696035.36,1542535.22,-,2309171.0,1779387.5,1376059.03,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

The Charter has 12 thematic areas of concern that is based on the discussions and recommendations of broad state level consultations with 300 participants (240 female and 60 males, including 50 persons with disabilities (PWD)) as well as 1,000 IDPs and returnees (500 females and 500 males, including 8% of PWD). UN Women led the process of developing the Charter which was started in 2022. ",28037.0,23575.36,17306.62,-,28037.0,21743.33,18088.54,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

This included mobile teams, national door-to-door campaigns and supplementary immunization activities to support the Ministry of Health in achieving results at scale. UNICEF‚Äôs technical and financial support drove the increase in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) coverage to 95 per cent among girls aged 10-14 (75 per cent in 2023) improving health care for adolescent girls and advancing the UNICEF Gender Action Plan. Measles and rubella vaccine achieved 90 per cent coverage (85 per cent in 2023). STP remained free of polio and eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus, thanks to the major contribution of UNICEF on immunization.Despite significant effort, the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine rate for children aged 0-11 months, which stayed above 90 per cent for two decades, gradually fell to 87 per cent in 2024 (90 per cent in 2023), below the target for this key result. Contributing factors include workforce shortages due to emigration and vaccine resistance.To promote vaccination uptake for HPV and reverse the downward trend in pentavalent coverage, UNICEF partnered with 50 youth associations and the Youth National Council to conduct community engagement and SBC activities, focusing on adolescents and youth. In 50 communities, 9,000 adolescents (55 per cent girls) received education on vaccination and 50 community health workers were trained. As a result, 25 per cent of Santomean adolescents gained stronger knowledge on COVID-19 and HPV, while 40 per cent were encouraged to adopt preventive behaviours, driving increased demand for routine vaccines. The full impact of these efforts on pentavalent is expected in 2025.Key advocacy and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health, jointly with immunization partners (Gavi, WHO), led to significant achievements offering positive prospects for enhanced performance and sustainability of the Expanded Programme on Immunization and health system strengthening: development of the costing component of the National Immunization Strategy set for validation in 2025; extension of the country's Transition to Vaccine Autonomy; vaccine co-financing commitments of the Ministry of Health, help in budgeting vaccine needs and preparation for the implementation of the Cold Chain Equipment Optimization Platform, approved by GAVI.In 2024, UNICEF contributed to improve child health through the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses. By directly providing essential drugs, UNICEF helped maintain the continuity of quality health services at both central and district levels contributing to the survival of 18,227 children under five (68 per cent). Additionally, 107,705 children and adolescents accessed primary health care in UNICEF supported facilities, an increase of 27,000 from 2023. UNICEF‚Äôs integrated interventions and provision of HIV tests and antiretroviral ensured that 100 per cent of pregnant women were tested for HIV during their first consultation. This led to zero cases of Mother-to-Child Transmission, in line with the UNICEF Gender Action Plan, maintaining the trend towards eliminating transmission by 2025. However, limited funds slowed the achievement of adolescent health objectives. In 2025, efforts will focus on mobilizing funds to address this gap and supporting a national strategy.UNICEF supplemented over 23,240 children at risk (18,926 in 2023) with vitamin A, reaching 85 per cent of the targeted children aged 6-59 months (80 per cent in 2023), demonstrating a positive trend since 2022.",389176.0,332020.8,279046.63,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

This included people in drought-affected areas and those in provinces with some of the highest global acute malnutrition rates, including Benguela, Moxico, Bi√©, Cuando Cubango, Cuanza Sul, and Lunda Norte, to whom WFP provided SNFs and trained government healthcare workers. In drought-affected provinces, WFP provided food assistance, through commodity vouchers, to families of children diagnosed with MAM (31,000 people reached) over a two-month period to improve recovery rates and household food security and nutrition outcomes. Overall, WFP transferred USD 700,000 to people through commodity vouchers. WFP contracted local retailers, ensuring efficient, cost-effective, and timely delivery of commodities to households.WFP reached most people in the second half of 2024, following the confirmation of resources earmarked for the El Ni√±o response. However, due to severe underfunding, WFP had to scale down its drought response, allocating available resources efficiently to prioritised locations and targeting the most vulnerable population groups.WFP and its cooperating partner trained 125 community health workers (CHWs) on the management of acute malnutrition for both children and PBWG. This training covered screening, active case finding, supplementation, counselling, stock management, and commodity vouchers. By utilising CHWs to support outpatient malnutrition prevention and supplementation, WFP reduced costs compared to inpatient care while maintaining effectiveness in reaching a significant number of children and PBWG, including those in remote and hard-to-reach areas.In line with corporate mandates, WFP coordinated with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to integrate the management of severe and moderate acute malnutrition cases through referrals and collaboration.Alongside the provision of life-saving SNFs and commodity vouchers, WFP delivered social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) messaging to over 115,500 people, including parents, caregivers and community leaders, aiming to promote healthy and nutritious practices.Monitoring findings show that WFP's integrated nutrition programme recorded positive results, achieving an 86 and 92 percent recovery rate for children in Cunene and Hu√≠la, respectively. This exceeded international SPHERE standards, demonstrating the effectiveness and the impact of the comprehensive approach adopted by WFP, combining community screening and the provision of SNFs with food assistance and SBCC for positive nutrition outcomes.",136000.0,98400.15,81823.56,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Introduction_x000D_
Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique on 14-15 March, leaving behind a swath of destruction in Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambezia provinces. The hardest hit area is the coastal city of Beira in Sofala Province, 90% of infrastructure is estimated to have been destroyed. According to the World Bank, it estimated that the capital damages of buildings, infrastructure and agriculture amount to $656m- $773m . The Project aims to respond to immediate, emergency needs ‚Äì getting children (aged 3- 18 years old) back into school and learning by: establishing temporary learning spaces, providing roofing for classrooms and through child-lead disaster risk reduction activities. This immediate phase will be dovetailed into and strategically linked with planning and investments for durable solutions in the form of quality, gender-sensitive rehabilitation efforts over the first 12 months following Cyclone Idai. _x000D_

WFP‚Äôs school feeding programming was scaled up in northern Ethiopia, to respond to the significant need in conflict-affected areas. School feeding remains one of the most important factors for attracting children to school and thereby increasing enrolment and attendance, particularly for girls. With over 7.6 million school children out of school, school feeding remains a critical social safety net in Ethiopia.Over 120,000 school children were reached by WFP through the home-grown school feeding modality, where food items to supply the school feeding programme were locally procured from smallholder farmers and cooperative unions. This modality magnifies the impact of the school feeding programme, contributing to stimulating local economies, strengthening market linkages, and incentivizing increased and diversified agricultural production. Over $3 million USD was contributed by WFP to support local procurement for the home-grown school feeding programme during the February 2023 and September 2023 school semesters, directly benefiting over 5,000 smallholder farmers.A fresh food pilot was scaled up in SNNPR to provide over 15,000 school children in 45 schools with a daily school meal incorporating fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs. This fresh-food inclusive school meal contributes to improved dietary diversity and improved nutrition of school children. To further support these outcomes, WFP is providing technical and financial support to school gardens. School gardens have provided a SBCC platform for improving agricultural practices while simultaneously encouraging diversification of livelihoods and diets at household level. To support both activities, WFP supported drafting and dissemination of fresh food procurement guidelines and school gardening manual.WFP continued to support capacity strengthening at all levels of government, to enable scale-up of the national home-grown school feeding programme. This included both financial and technical support. WFP supported development of the National Home-Grown School Feeding Implementation Guidelines, which are awaiting endorsement. WFP facilitated South-South exchange through sponsoring Ministry of Education participation in the Global School Meals Coalition sub-regional East Africa Network Launch in June 2023, as well as the first Global School Meals Coalition ministerial summit in Paris in Oct 2023.In March 2023, Ethiopia hosted the 8th African Day of School Feeding (ADSF) continental commemoration, supported by WFP. High-level representatives discussed the importance of Home-Grown School Feeding as a key policy for countries to respond to the current crisis. Stakeholders from the public, private, civil society, and development partner sectors were involved to raise awareness and knowledge on school feeding, to take stock of progress made and stimulate political support for the adoption of HGSF, and implementation and sustainability for pro-school feeding policies, programmes, and investments. The agenda also presented opportunity to visit Addis Ababa schools and exchange on best practices for local procurement and opportunity for public-private partnerships to benefit the HGSF value chain.",49183366.0,36499583.3,34106215.25,"WFP reached over 402,000 school children (46% girls) with nutritious school meals, addressing immediate food needs, improving learning outcomes, and strengthening human capital development. The program targeted 1,179 primary schools, prioritizing food-insecure and shock-affected areas. Home-grown school feeding bolstered local economies by linking smallholder farmers with schools as sustainable markets to supply local produce for school meals. The program's multisectoral approach has generated a significant return on investment, with a recent value-for-money study showing a benefit-to-cost ratio of up to USD 7 for each dollar invested. Technical assistance to the Government was coordinated through the development of national guidelines and a resource mobilization strategy. The Government's commitment to school feeding is evident through increased program coverage and budget allocation.",40521480.0,33979875.01,27103936.72,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

‚Ä¢ Weak coordination around data sharing and use
‚Ä¢ Confusion and fatigue among providers of data

WFP extended its support to 200 additional schools across three new districts: Mzimba (North and South), Nkhatabay, and Rumphi. Furthermore, 34 schools in Chikwawa and Nsanje were added, and 78 Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres were included in the programme. This expansion brought the total number of primary schools supported to 778, up from 544 the previous year. A total of 837,026 primary school learners (426,127 girls and 410,899 boys) benefited from daily nutritious meals. These meals were made from a combination of staple foods, legumes, roots, tubers, vegetables, and fruits from the six food groups commonly found in Malawi. The schools that received support are in 11 districts, including Chikwawa, Dedza, Kasungu, Mangochi, Mzimba, Nkhatabay, Nsanje, Phalombe, Rumphi, Salima, and Zomba. In addition, 15,448 learners (8,438 girls and 7,010 boys) from 140 ECD centres in seven districts benefited from similar nutritious meals. ÔªøIn total, 24,405 smallholder farmers, organised in farmer groups, supplied food commodities to the schools, helping to create a stable market for their produce and improving the local economy. Additionally, 44,951 small holder farmers benefitted from the homegrown school feeding programme through various interventions including trainings on agricultural practices, including post-harvest loss mitigation and crop diversification. UNICEF Key Achievements: UNICEF scaled up high-impact, equitable nutrition interventions in Malawi by leveraging food, health, education, social protection, and WASH systems. Over 1.5 million children were screened for wasting, with 40,811 treated, while vitamin A and micronutrient supplementation improved child nutrition. Nutrition-sensitive social protection programs, such as cash transfers targeting households with children under two, and community-based Care Groups engaged local volunteers to promote health and nutrition practices. UNICEF enhanced dietary diversity through initiatives like distributing chickens, fruit trees, and supporting backyard gardens for over 90,000 households. Education systems were leveraged to deliver iron and folate supplements to adolescent girls and establish school health clubs addressing nutrition, hygiene, and gender-sensitive practices. WASH systems ensured access to safe water for 1.41 million people and improved sanitation for over 110,000 individuals, contributing to disease prevention. Through the First Foods Africa Initiative, nutrient-enriched crops, food processing training, and innovative supplements like fish powder were introduced to diversify diets. UNICEF‚Äôs efforts aligned with the national Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection framework, promoting cross-sector collaboration for sustainable outcomes. These integrated interventions strengthened resilience and addressed malnutrition among vulnerable populations, demonstrating a holistic, multi-system approach to improving child nutrition and well-being.Challenges: Insufficient coverage of nutrition-sensitive interventions in remote areas.Opportunities: UNICEF considers leveraging on school systems and community networks to improve dietary practices and address malnutrition sustainably.WHO: WHO has contributed to the enhancement of the health systems capacity to improve the quality of inpatient care for children with severe malnutrition through the training and mentorship of over 60 health care workers from nutrition rehabilitation units in 15 districts worst affected by disasters on the management of children admitted with severe malnutrition and the provision of PED-SAM kits to 18 districts. Furthermore, WHO has supported the evaluation of the implementation of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiave Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding who findings will inform national policy and programming to protect, promote and support breastfeeding.",24195496.0,17467092.08,16593737.48,"In line with the Government‚Äôs objective to increase the coverage of school meals from 43 percent to 100 percent by 2030, WFP made significant progress in scaling up the HGSF programme in 2024.

In 2024, WFP continued supporting the government in implementing nutrition-related activities in line with policy, strategic and operational guidance. Key achievements included assisting in finalising the National Multisectoral Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan; supporting the review of critical policy tools such as the National Nutrition Strategic Plan and Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines, adapting them to the 2023 WHO guidelines for managing child wasting and oedema; supporting nutrition evidence generation by providing technical and financial support to the Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) survey and Food and Nutrition security assessment for people living with HIV and tuberculosis (PLHIV/TB) to assess the nutrition situation of the various nutrition vulnerable groups following recurrent shocks particularly the 2024 El Ni√±o-induced drought, which worsened food insecurity and malnutrition.  In response to rising global acute malnutrition (from 2.2% in 2020 to 4.4% in 2024), WFP resumed its supplementary feeding programme in four priority districts of Machinga, Chikwawa, Nsanje and Blantyre, targeting children aged 6 to 59 months. Of the 23,000 children targeted from September 2024 to May 2025, over 11,000 were reached across 107 health facilities, with a cure rate of 84%, surpassing the 75% SPHERE standard. Additionally, with 46% food insecurity and 26% malnutrition among this group, WFP implemented an integrated Nutrition and HIV project in Chikwawa district, benefiting 2,400 individuals in 16 HIV support groups. This initiative provided training in nutrition, financial literacy, and livelihood skills and distributed agricultural resources to improve food security and livelihoods. Among the beneficiaries, 84% showed improved nutrition behaviours and knowledge in diet diversification, finance, and livestock management.  At the subnational level, WFP supported malnutrition prevention activities in Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe, and Zomba districts. District councils and partners conducted 348 care group visits, disseminating essential nutrition information, reaching 38,447 households (76,894 people, 66% women). Through mass awareness campaigns and radio broadcasts, over 740,000 people (58% women) received nutrition social behaviour change messages. Beneficiaries also received assets to support dietary diversification and sanitation improvements. WFP supported district councils by enhancing facility- and community-level nutrition programming through regular coordination and review meetings.  ",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

A key milestone was achieved with an 11% increase in enrollment for learners with special needs, benefiting 215,224 children nationwide. This progress was enabled by training 102 headteachers in inclusive education practices, training of 4,165 teachers (2000 females) in inclusive methodologies, refurbishing 60 inclusive education resource centers in 12 districts, early screening initiatives, and providing assistive devices like hearing aids and wheelchairs. The government has committed MWK 1.5 billion to expand these resource centers, ensuring scalability.UNICEF also supported 21,623 out-of-school adolescents through complementary basic education and functional literacy programs, equipping them with foundational skills and enabling transitions to formal education or employment. Additionally, 360 adolescents were trained as mental health champions, delivering interventions that reached 1,720 peers and enhancing grassroots-level mental health awareness. In disaster risk management, 467 schools developed disaster risk reduction plans, while emergency responses helped 66,054 learners resume education after El Ni√±o floods, building resilience in education systems.Challenges: Inadequate infrastructure for inclusive education; limited resources for teacher training programs.Opportunities: Scale up digital learning platforms and pre-primary education programs for equitable accessIOM: IOM reached 16,998 people (10,488F, 6,510M), including fisherfolk, fish processors, migrants, and sex workers along Lake Malawi's beaches and key migration routes in Mwanza, Neno, and Mchinji. Participants received comprehensive information on Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR), HIV/AIDS, STIs, pregnancy, contraception, and cholera prevention, leading to improved health awareness and access to essential services among vulnerable populations. This initiative enhanced community knowledge and contributed to safer health practices in high-risk areas. Challenges: Distance to remote areas from health centers make sustainability of mobile clinic difficult.  Lessons: Good collaboration with the Government and utilizing already existing community structures enhances implementation of outreach clinics through which sexuality education is provided to the youth and other vulnerable groupsOpportunities: cooperation between UNICEF and IOM strengthened some Beach Village Communities holistically in their operations and functionality, creating synergies. Change agents have an impact on health outcomes in communities' long-term, a proven concept that shall be excelled. C-Stock methodology would enhance efficiency in medical delivery and stock availability, minimizing shortfalls.  UNESCOUNESCO supported the review of the primary and secondary curriculum which includes Life Skills Education (LSE), by participating in the Education Conference and Curriculum Symposium which sought to get input from stakeholders on the revision of the curriculum. Participation in these activities was to ensure that a case was presented for continuation of LSE in the curriculum.Further in 2024, UNESCO made significant progress in building teacher capacity through the training of 1,900 primary and 50 secondary school teachers on LSE using existing structures within the MoE to ensure sustainability. Innovative training approaches effectively addressed teachers‚Äô hesitancy and discomfort in delivering sensitive subject matter, resulting in reported increased confidence and comfort in teaching LSE, particularly through participatory and learner-centred teaching methods. Teachers have also become advocates for LSE, raising awareness within the school community and among parents.

Les principaux domaines d'impact se d√©clinent comme suit :1. Am√©lioration de l'acc√®s √† l'√©ducation pour les enfants r√©fugi√©sLe projet a permis √† 1 000 enfants demandeurs d‚Äôasile en √¢ge scolaire d'acc√©der √† un environnement d‚Äôapprentissage stable. Il a assur√© la fourniture des ressources essentielles telles que les kits scolaires et la formation des enseignants b√©n√©voles. Cet acc√®s √† l'√©ducation constitue un levier fondamental pour aider ces enfants √† se reconstruire apr√®s les traumatismes subis lors de leur fuite vers le nord de la C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire.Au niveau communautaire, des activit√©s r√©cr√©atives, sportives et de lecture anim√©e, organis√©es dans les espaces amis des enfants situ√©s sur les sites d‚Äôaccueil de Timalah et de Niornigu√©, ont renforc√© les comp√©tences et les r√©flexes n√©cessaires aux enfants pour jouer un r√¥le actif dans le d√©veloppement de leur communaut√© √† long terme.2. Renforcement du syst√®me √©ducatif localLe projet a recrut√© et form√© 12 enseignants b√©n√©voles en collaboration avec les directions r√©gionales de l‚Äô√©ducation nationale et de l‚Äôalphab√©tisation de Niornigu√© et de Timalah. Ce renforcement des capacit√©s √©ducatives locales s'est traduit par un soutien direct aux √©coles existantes.‚Ä¢ Pour les enseignants : L'acc√®s √† une formation adapt√©e aux besoins des enfants demandeurs d‚Äôasile et √† la gestion des salles de classe en contexte de crise a enrichi leurs pratiques p√©dagogiques. Il a √©galement consolid√© l‚Äôengagement de l‚Äô√âtat de C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire envers l'√©ducation, en alignement avec les Objectifs de d√©veloppement durable (ODD).‚Ä¢ Pour les √©coles : Le recours aux enseignants b√©n√©voles a permis d'all√©ger la charge des enseignants locaux, am√©liorant ainsi la qualit√© de l'enseignement pour les enfants demandeurs d‚Äôasile comme pour les enfants locaux. Cette initiative a favoris√© une dynamique de partage et d'entraide.3. Int√©gration sociale des enfants demandeurs d‚ÄôasileLes activit√©s extrascolaires organis√©es pour les 1 000 enfants au sein des espaces amis des enfants (EAE) ont contribu√© √† leur bien-√™tre mental et physique, favorisant leur int√©gration sociale. Ces activit√©s ont renforc√© les √©changes culturels et les moments de convivialit√©, r√©duisant ainsi les risques de stigmatisation et d'isolement.‚Ä¢ Pour les enfants : Un environnement inclusif leur permet de d√©velopper des comp√©tences sociales et de renforcer leur r√©silience face aux difficult√©s rencontr√©es.‚Ä¢ Au niveau communautaire : Le renforcement des liens entre les enfants locaux et r√©fugi√©s contribue √† r√©duire les tensions communautaires et √† instaurer un climat de solidarit√© et de coexistence pacifique.4. Sensibilisation de la communaut√© √©ducative aux enjeux de l'√©ducation et de la protectionDix s√©ances de sensibilisation ont √©t√© organis√©es sur des th√®mes transversaux li√©s √† l'√©ducation et √† la protection, notamment :‚Ä¢ L'importance de la scolarisation des enfants, en particulier des jeunes filles‚Ä¢ Les droits des enfants et la proc√©dure de d√©claration des naissancesCes sessions ont eu un impact durable sur toute la communaut√©, incluant les chefs communautaires, les parents, les enseignants et les enfants.‚Ä¢ Pour les parents et les leaders communautaires : Une meilleure compr√©hension des enjeux √©ducatifs et des droits des demandeurs d‚Äôasile a √©t√© favoris√©e, renfor√ßant ainsi le soutien aux initiatives √©ducatives et r√©duisant les risques de violence et de discrimination dans les localit√©s d‚Äôaccueil.‚Ä¢ Pour les enseignants : En plus de la formation p√©dagogique, ils ont √©t√© sensibilis√©s √† des th√©matiques essentielles telles que la protection de l‚Äôenfance, le respect des droits des enfants, la d√©claration des naissances et la pr√©vention des violences bas√©es sur le genre (VBG).

As a result of the crises of insecurity, children of school age in some parts of Nigeria, particularly the Northern region have limited and in some cases no access to school. More worrisome, is the plight of learners with special needs, as infrastructure/equipment to aid their learnings are not available. The increasing emergencies that interrupt school systems and ultimately learning requires systemic preparedness that will ensure that learning continues without leaving anyone behind.

 It is in this regards that the implementation of the right to education, including creating lifelong learning opportunities will be pursued within the 42 C5 programmes and activities. To achieve this, UNEESCO will strengthen partnerships and networks to promote cross-sectoral collaboration that will stimulate technical dialogues, policies and practices that assures the learning needs of marginalized groups.
ICH will be addressed through Education, and States including the FCT, would be engaged to review ESP to ensure inclusive education is mainstreamed and budgeted for. Cross-sectoral collaboration with health, nutrition and social protection will be encouraged.

With number of crises affected areas increasing, there is need to apply the inclusive approach to education system and ensure no one is left behind. UNESCO is committed to taking concerted action to eliminate all forms of exclusions and marginalization, to uphold the right to education for all, to address disparities and inequalities in access, and in quality of learning, as well as to build education systems that are resilient and responsive to contemporary challenges. It implies focusing on those at greatest risk of being left behind and addressing inequalities in the education policies and practices. In view of this, UNESCO Abuja would:

i.      Support multistakeholder dialogues on facilitating inclusive education in Nigeria.
ii.    Work with the Nigeria‚Äôs Governors forum to advocate for policies and practices that promotes inclusive education in all states of the federation.

The provision of tablets, internet connectivity, capacity building of 20 secondary school teachers on facilitation of coding training, the development of coding training manual as well as the development of a coding learning management system have set or improved infrastructure for coding training in secondary schools.UNICEFKey Achievements: UNICEF Malawi has made significant strides in advancing quality and inclusive education. In 2024, 20,329 double-seater desks were delivered, benefiting 81,316 primary school learners (40,658 girls) and improving classroom environments. The development of the National Education Policy and the EMIS Governance Framework enhanced education sector management, emphasizing data-driven decision-making and effective policy implementation. To support early childhood education, UNICEF facilitated the phased introduction of pre-primary classes for 5-year-olds in public schools. Preparatory activities included nationwide consultations, school mapping, and the development of a play-based curriculum. An ECE Costing and Financing Study provided a roadmap for expanding pre-primary education. UNICEF also scaled up the Teacher Mentorship Program, developing a comprehensive framework and training 410 trainers through 11 Teacher Training Colleges. The e-CPD platform was strengthened, enabling remote teacher training, with 70 education officials trained to support its use, advancing digital literacy. Through the Connect-a-School initiative, 18 schools were connected to the internet, benefiting 15,566 learners (50% girls) and 503 teachers. Additionally, 8,266 schools were mapped under the GIGA initiative, enabling data-driven digital education planning. ICT infrastructure upgrades were also implemented in key schools, including Kamwanya, Chayamba, Salima, Mwanza, Machinga, Kachanga, Misuku, Maghemo, and Kaweche. These efforts, supported by the GPE-funded Tech4Ed initiative, highlight UNICEF‚Äôs commitment to leveraging technology to improve access, quality, and continuity in educationChallenges: Low to none internet connectivity in rural schools and high student-to-teacher ratios in primary schools limit the school's capacity to deliver digital education.Opportunities: Expand digital education initiatives and promote innovative teacher training methods.UNESCOIn the spirit of Leaving No One Behind, UNESCO advanced disability-inclusive LSE, working with the MoE to provide support to the Montfort Special Needs Education College (MSNEC) to review the current LSE course outline. This collaboration is aimed at making the LSE content more practical and needs-driven, for instance through introducing ideas to create disability-inclusive teaching and learning aids using locally available materials. Additionally, UNESCO began engaging inclusive education coordinators, who are stationed in each district across the country and are mandated to support teachers at resource centres within their districts. These coordinators were sensitized on inclusive LSE, building on lessons learned from the training-of-trainers (TOT) workshop on the Breaking the Silence (BtS) approach to CSE for teachers of learners with disabilities conducted in Malawi in 2021.Numbers reached:40 Resource Coordinators (26 male, 14 female)UNHCR: In 2024, UNHCR and its partners supported government efforts in education by providing staff and resource support to over 16,000 children and youth across preschool, primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.

Pre-service teacher training was strengthened through a new profile for teacher-trainers developed with UNICEF support, while the capacity of in-service teacher training benefitted from training distance in-service teacher trainers using a new curriculum. 2,110 Cycle Coordinators increased their knowledge on Numeracy and Literacy teaching programs and on participatory teaching-learning methods, which in turn will benefit all teachers in their cycles. The overall quality of the teaching-learning process in the classroom in target schools have furthermore improved through distribution of 7,662 teaching/learning kits. ÔªøThe capacity of teachers already deployed in the system has been strengthened this year. Against a target of 377, a total of 2,110 Cycle Coordinators (CCs) increased their knowledge on Numeracy (1,079 CCs); Handling and Use of Teaching Programs in Literacy (287 CCs) and Participatory Teaching-Learning Methods (744 CCs) through trainings supported by UNICEF. The trainings follow a ‚Äúlearning-by-doing‚Äù approach through regular joint planning of lessons as well as peer observation of lessons. This gives the CCs opportunities to share what they have learned in their respective schools, enhancing their overall capacity to coordinate and support teachers within their Cycle. The trainings have been complemented by the delivery of 707 Reading kits, 1,165 Teachers‚Äô Numeracy Kits and 5,790 Learners‚Äô Numeracy Kits to schools in target districts. The Kits are composed of textbooks for students and materials for teachers to use on blackboards and will improve the overall quality of the teaching-learning process in the classroom.  Distance in-service teacher trainers from four school-based learning centers for teachers (N√∫cleos Pedag√≥gicos) and one Teacher-Training Institute (IFP Nuforpe) have strengthened their capacity to support in-service teachers reaching the level of teachers being trained through the current Initial Training Curricula through UNICEF-supported trainings on a new teacher training curriculum for distance in-service teacher training. The new distance teacher training curriculum (approved in 2021) is aligned with the professional qualifications of the pre-service teacher training, a key achievement for teacher professional development. On School management, the capacity of IFP trainers has been enhanced through support to 24 trainers in Nampula and 18 in Zambezia. This resulted in quality training of 494 school managers (SM) on school development plans, reaching 66 per cent of SM in Zambezia (against target of 65 per cent) and 16.8 per cent of SM in Nampula (against target of 15 per cent).  On District Supervision (DS), the DS tools/online platform have improved this year through UNICEF support. MINEDH initiated revision of the DS tools with the aim of strengthening school functionality. In addition to the four original areas (Pedagogic management, School council, Funding management and teacher absenteeism), the revised version is expected to include new areas such as inclusive education, WASH, and qualitative indicators. DS will also be expanded to cover youth and adult education centers, learning support centers, distance secondary education and bilingual education. Piloting the DS online platform has shown improvements to the DS FPs‚Äô analysis of data, contributing to improved quality of reporting on school-level indicators. The revision will require updates of the online platform and training of supervisors in 2023. 64 per cent of schools in Zambezia received monitoring visits (against target of 65 per cent), while 26.6 per cent of schools in Nampula received monitoring visits (against target of 25 per cent).",2420000.0,1708895.34,1556597.79,"UNICEF Mozambique continued to invest in teacher's capacities and school management and as a result, a total of 1,248 cycle coordinators have increased knowledge on numeracy, literacy teaching programmes and participatory teaching-learning methods, contributing to a systematic peer support for teachers to improve the teaching and learning process at classroom level. Teacher training profile was also developed, and recruitment process is also in place.    As part of the Learning Passport initiative, with UNICEF‚Äôs technical and financial support, MINEDH (Distance and Open Education Institute -IEDA, National Institute of Education Development - INDE, National Directorate of Primary Education - DINEP) developed 24 materials for Grade 1 and 2 on Portuguese and Mathematics and completed the pre-test of the LP platform and is currently preparing for the launch and the pilot including training of teachers in Cabo Delgado province. A total of 340 tablets (School in a Box) with solar panels were procured by UNICEF for the pilot and the Learning Passport programme mobile application is being made ready by MINEDH to be published on Google Play. UNICEF also facilitated MINEDH‚Äôs support from GIGA in terms of school mapping on connectivity.                                                                                    A total of 520 School managers in Zambezia, Nampula and Sofala provinces (178 female) increased knowledge on School management through training, with UNICEF support and benefited from practical exercises in their work environment. They also benefitted from guiding manuals to serve as consultation tools during their daily work. To assess the effectiveness of the training, a performance assessment for managers trained is ongoing and results will be shared in 2024.Furthermore, MINEDH completed the revision of the District Supervision tools aimed at strengthening school functionality with UNICEF support. In addition to the four original areas (Pedagogic management, School council, Funding management and teacher absenteeism), the revised version includes new areas such as inclusive education, WASH, youth and adult education, and bilingual education. A total of 40 District Supervisors focal points developed skills to use  the online platform and revised tool and participated in the piloting of the online platform in Nampula, Zambezia and Sofala. In 2024, monitoring activities will be critical to assess the functionality of these interventions for further improvement.ÔªøDuring the pre-test of the Learning Passport platform with teachers, children, and parents to assess its functionality, MINEDH and UNICEF received valuable feedback from users and learned not only the importance of the internet connection but also the need to develop more interactive materials for the platform. UNICEF will support MINEDH to increase these materials from 2024 onwards. MINEDH and UNICEF are now developing a mobile application to allow users to access the LP platform in an innovative way (offline) after downloading.For District Supervision, a new lighter platform was developed to support collection of school data from areas that underpin a quality school. The new platform allows visualization of data collection instruments and analysis of collected information, making it user and reader-friendly, which was not possible with the previous platform.

Second, the technical validation of the National Strategy for Out-of-School Children significantly increases the education sector‚Äôs capacity to address the multifaceted and complex issues that impede access to education. The strategy includes policy responses and proposals to address demand side (sociocultural and economic barriers) and supply side (access to educational services and government oversight) bottlenecks. To provide clear, concrete guidance to MENESIC the strategy is complemented by a budgeted operational plan that delineates and costs activities needed to achieve the intended policy objectives. The operational plan includes a systematic monitoring and evaluation framework with indicators to monitor the strategy‚Äôs implementation. The strategy and costed operational plan, developed with technical and financial assistance from the UN, increase MENESIC‚Äôs capacity to decrease the number of out-of-school education in 2024 and beyond.With UN support, in 2023 MENESIC made significant progress developing a comprehensive accelerated learning programme for out-of-school children - a key recommendation included in the National Strategy for Out-of-School Children. A strategic result was the finalization of the accelerated education curriculum, developed over two years and the culmination of a strong partnership between the UN, the National Institute for Educational Development (INDE), the Funda√ßao Calouste Gulbenkian (FCG), and the University of Minho (UM). The curriculum provides comprehensive learning pathways for out-of-school and at-risk children and adolescents to catch-up and accelerate their learning. Developed by the same technical team who developed the new basic education curriculum for Grades 1-6, the accelerated learning curriculum includes clear curricular guidelines, 13 teacher guides and 13 student manuals. This curriculum is but one core element of the accelerated learning programme; in the last quarter of 2023 the UN, INDE, FCG, and UM jointly developed a roadmap establishing the legal, administrative, and technical conditions to pilot accelerated learning with over 900 adolescents in 2024. In addition, by leveraging its convening power and thanks to sustained advocacy efforts, the UN effectively revived discussions on integrating Islamic schools into the formal education system. Existing research and data on Islamic education produced since 2008 was first systemically analyzed and mapped and constraints identified that impeded previous integration efforts. UNICEF conducted a focus group discussion with 14 people from the Ministry of Education and key civil society stakeholders, including community and religious leaders, Islamic educators, teachers‚Äô unions, parent associations and youth leaders. Subsequent bilateral meetings with the president of National Union of Imams and the Guinea-Bissau representative of the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ICESCO) further established trust and constructive dialogue. Due to these efforts, a high-level multi-directorate team at the Ministry of Education has been mandated to develop a comprehensive roadmap to strengthen public oversight of madrassas and qur‚Äôanic schools.",325000.0,287128.36,235894.06,-,325000.0,224497.7,213272.81,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

UNHCR Update In 2022, UNHCR continued to support the development and finalization of the Education Response Plan II whose aspirations are aligned to the Education Sector Strategy (RRP 2022-2023) and the National Development Plan III (NDP II). The ERP II aims to ensure that 690,540 children, adolescents, and youth from the refugee and host communities, have access to sustained quality and inclusive learning opportunities. The Education Response Plan II for Refugees and Host Community in Uganda (ERPII) provides a comprehensive plan aimed to mobilize resources and coordinate efforts which caters for the education of refugees and host communities in Uganda. The ERPII is a successor of the ERPI which aimed to ensure access to quality education for 567,500 refugee and children in the host-communities per year, over a period of 3.5 years (2019 to 2021) at a cost of $389million. The Plan will be implemented in the 37 sub counties in the 13 refugee hosting districts including Kampala. ERPII is anchored in a firm policy framework, annexed to the Education and Sports Strategic Plan (ESSP) FY 2020/21-2024/25, tethered to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the African Union Agenda 2063, the Comprehensive Refuge Response Framework, and the National Development Plan III (2020/21 - 2024/25) among others. The Ministry of Education and Sports together with the line Ministries of Local Government, Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and partners conducted a monitoring and field verification exercise to assess the progress of the previously agreed actions and document achievements and challenges registered. The exercise covered all schools (Preprimary, primary and secondary) in the 13 Refugee Hosting Districts. Refugee learners were successfully registered in the Education Management and Information System (EMIS) in all refugee hosting districts. Prior to registration, partner staff and teachers responsible for data collection and Monitoring and Evaluation, were capacitated with digital data collection skills and acquittance in usage of the EMIS at school level. UNHCR has supported education of children with disabilities in refugee and host districts through different partners by paying schools fees for the children, training of teachers on SNE pedagogy and provision of instructional materials. Majority of learners with special needs have always been sent to neighboring districts for the refugee ad host communities to access education. This has helped many learners with special needs not to be left out. Despite all efforts special needs schools are not enough and some are not accessible for learners with special needs. WFP purchased 417 mt of cereals worth USD 314,000 from SHF to support the local school feeding programme in Karamoja under the Karamoja Feeds Karamoja Phase II Project. Through this, WFP reached 205,903 learners (47 percent females, 53 percent male) from 315 primary and secondary schools with nutritious school meals. This represented a 69.3 percent increase compared to 2021[1].",12092798.0,10313260.58,7050987.25,"WFP: School Feeding Programme In partnership with the Government of Uganda, WFP provided school meals in Karamoja sub-region. This region is faced with low literacy levels of 25 percent compared to the national average of 79 percent, and other socio-economic disruptions. Low literacy levels are a major contributor to Karamoja being the poorest region in the country. Parents often withdraw their children from school to help with house chores, particularly older girls, which results into sporadic attendance, dropouts, and diminished academic achievements. The school feeding programme was conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) and District Local Governments (DLGs) in Karamoja. The MoES assumes the mantle of technical oversight while the district technical staff oversee the day-to-day school feeding operations. Financial contributions for school feeding came from various WFP donors and partners. This enabled WFP to provide hot meals to learners in all supported schools despite delayed funding confirmations which led to ration cuts in schools by 20 percent in the second half of the year. WFP provided nutritious meals to 216,301 learners (47 percent girls and 53 percent boys) in 315 educational facilities (primary, secondary, and vocational). This is an increase of 5 percent compared to 2022. School education outcomes indicated an increase in enrolment by 24 percent overall (27 percent for girls and 21 percent for boys) in 2023 compared to 2022 (20 percent). The attendance rate stood at 72 percent (72 percent girls and 72 percent boys).UNFPAIntegration of VSLA in ELA clubs: 72 groups with 593 adolescents were trained and graduated on  Livelihood. ELA clubs in Abim, Amuria, Nakapiripirit, Moroto, Yumbe and Kiryadongo have learnt to integrate VSLA to generate income and support their small scale businesses as well as keeping them together and supporting each other to acquire SRH services especially the girls during maternity. The groups have accumulated a total saving of 7,994,000/= social welfare 557,000/= and loan disbursement of 2,832,000/= to club members for business as individuals and group utilization. A total of 42,879 young people (boys  girls) reached through young people empowerment clubs.UNHCRAchievements: In the Education Sector, there has been an overall increase in gross enrolment (GE) from 53% in Term 3 in 2022 to 55% in Term One 2023 within the refugee population. The gross enrolment rate (GER) for pre-primary and secondary remained 44% and 10% respectively. In primary, there was an increase from 94% to 95%. One other success of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and its partners has been the approval of the second Education Response Plan (ERP II) for Refugee and Host Communities.UNICEFThrough UNCEF 52,235 (22,766 boys and 29,469 girls) children were enrolled in the ECD centres across the country and 1,111 ECD care givers were trained during the year. UNICEF initiated programs to improve learning access and competencies for children with disabilities. Utilizing LEGO bricks and assistive digital textbooks, 1,107 children in 45 inclusive schools across 12 non-focus districts benefited. UNICEF support a learning recovery program in 1,056 primary schools across 29 focus districts enabling 298,358 children to improve foundational literacy and numeracy skills including mental health and psychosocial support. UNICEF's efforts extended to improving School Management Committees (SMCs) through continuous capacity development, with 2,143 members and head teachers trained and mentored in 242 schools thus contributing to improved school monitoring and supervision. In humanitarian situations, UNICEF provided formal and non-formal education services ensuring continuity of teaching and learning for 89,502 vulnerable children. The services included alternative classrooms, mobile toilets, and assorted textbooks. As a result, five community schools in Nakivale refugees' settlements were coded as government-aided, expanding the support network from 7 to 12 schools,.ILOThrough the integrated UPSHIFT program, ILO is equipping youth with innovative skills to solve their developemnt challenges in an entrenueral way.

The finalized Programa Servi√ßos de Ac√ß√£o Social (ProSAS) manual will operationalize the case management system for child protection and support a multisectoral response to violence against children. The development of a revised curriculum for justice professionals commenced along with a juvenile diversion programme as an alternative to imprisonment. A joint programme on Mental Health and Psychological social services (MHPSS) was adopted to promote multisectoral coordination and advocacy for children‚Äôs and adolescents‚Äô well-being.In 2022, the operational manual on Programa Servi√ßos de Ac√ß√£o Social (ProSAS) - to prevent and respond to risks of violence and abuse through social welfare services - was finalized and endorsed at the technical level. The manual will operationalize the institutional case management system while ensuring a multisectoral response and a referral network though social welfare and other services (health, education, justice). The process also embedded a humanitarian and emergency component based on the SOPs developed by the CPoAR in Cabo Delgado. 2023 will focus on tools, guidance and training for the users in addition to advocacy for increased budgetary allocation to the ProSAS implementation process.   The roll out of the cash-care model of the child grant (0-2 years) continued in selected districts in the country with an expansion being planned to new 14 districts from 2022 reaching 6.500 families. UNICEF supported the strengthening of social workers' capacity using the e-learning platform, which was approved by the Government, and already trained 213 social workers. It is now considered an institutional tool for social workers across the country and is now managed by MGCAS to ensure sustainability. A total of 17 new social workers were recruited at national and subnational levels (3 selected provinces) to strengthen the capacity of MGCAS to enhance the social workforce for child protection. Advocacy efforts are underway to ensure their absorption on the government payroll.   Enhancement of response to cases of violence, abuse and child marriage was the focus in 2022. As a result of UNICEF technical and financial assistance, 3.351 women and girls' victims of violence had access to Integrated Center Assistance (CAI) (Ministry of Interior, 2022). Of 422 girls involved in child marriage, 398 were reunified with their biological families, and 24 have been placed in temporary shelter (MGCAS, 2022).  In 2022, interventions paved the way towards strengthening the linkages between the social welfare and justice sectors to build a robust child protection system. Within the court system, 1,718 court cases (1,555 GBV, and 163 children in conflict with the law) were processed and completed in five provinces with UNICEF support. Out of the 1,555 GBV cases, 48 of them related to child marriages. The Maputo juvenile court has now social services technicians in situ to support all cases involving juveniles. Support to the Police resulted in 105 awareness campaigns on child protection across the four focus provinces reaching 19,289 people and training of 25 investigation police officers. UNICEF continued to support legal aid through training of lawyers and provision of legal clinics to communities and the development of a training curriculum for justice professionals.   To ensure access to justice for children in conflict with the law - who are in adult prisons and are often in preventive detention (as of November 2022, 5,780 children in prisons) - 692 benefited from non-custodial sentences (596 boys and 96 girls). Through UNICEF technical support, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is at advanced stages to re-launch the ‚Äúcommunity service‚Äù and the ‚Äújuvenile diversion programmes‚Äù as alternative measures to imprisonment.",4342219.0,3395936.69,3085381.1,"Improving access to child protection services for children and their care givers remained a key priority for the Child Protection Program with a focus on access to justice and adequate social service, including access to justice for children‚Äôs victims, offenders or witnesses. In 2023, the drafting of foundational training modules and curriculum for justice professionals (prison guards, prosecutors, magistrates, and police) began, with pilot training, the process will be finalized in the first quarter of 2024. A capacity gap assessment of the Maputo Minor‚Äôs Court and Family Sections in other Provinces was undertaken, the findings will inform interventions to strengthen access to Justice for children in 2024.  During the period under review, a total of 6,562 children have been in contact with the justice system for various matters: 1,713 received support for civil cases, 2,299 were reported to the police for criminal activities, and 795 were abandoned children; 1,629 girls and boys victims of sexual abuse, 48 children rescued from trafficking situations. It is important to note that 78 children in conflict with the law benefitted from alternative sentencing measures through the Maputo Minors‚Äô Court with UNICEF‚Äôs support. A total of 725 349 (367, 507 girls) benefitted of birth registration.  As of October 2023, the Mozambique prison system had a total of 2,474 prisoners, of which 741 were children between 16-18 years old (38 of whom were girls), working with the Mozambique Prison Authorities (SERNAP), a particular attention was placed on strengthening the protection of children in conflict with an emphasis on children in detention and especially children affected by armed conflicts.Strengthening the social welfare systems remained another key priority: UNICEF working closely with the National Association of Social Workers (AASMO) and MGCAS, supported the development of a Supervision Framework for social workers and provided mentoring and technical support to front line workers. In addition, UNICEF facilitated access to formal education for 85 social workers in Instituto Superior de Ciencias de Saude (ISCISA), formal university for Social Work, through the provision of scholarships. In addition, ongoing training on MPHSS for social workers was provided to 108 social workers.The Child Protection Programme, strategically contributed to strengthening synergies with other sectors and in particular the social protection sector. The Child Grant Program was an opportunity to provide both cash and care to vulnerable families and their children. It contributed to build a strong institutional case management and a stronger social welfare service. As a result, a total of 4,537 most vulnerable families in 2023 of whom 2,459 girl victims of child marriage benefited from the programme. The Child Protection Programme, also contributed to strengthening the Integrated Centers Assistance to provide care and support to children victims of sexual violence including child marriage. A total of 8,554 children (6,267 girls and 2,347 boys) received care through the case management system by provincial social welfare in four provinces. It is important to note that child protection was strengthened at community level, with 63 Community based Child Protection Committees reactivated.",4584874.5,3082816.3,2504810.95,-,4584874.5,3114257.42,2501589.87,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

These schools were selected from two districts (Pujehun and Koinadugu). To help implement the CAHL (CSE) curriculum which was developed through UNFPA support in 2023, a total of 240 teachers were trained on the implementation of the CAHL curriculum in targeted schools. Additionally, the existing teaching and learning materials were revised to ensure that their design was youth friendly and culturally appropriate for the implementation of the CAHL curriculum in piloted schools. These teaching and learning materials will be distributed to pilot schools in early 2025. Under the Global Programme to End Child Marriage, UNFPA supported the safe space programme in 3 Districts - Koinadugu, Kambia and Pujehun to raise awareness of and protect vulnerable adolescent girls from Child Marriage and teenage pregnancy. The programme provided marginalised girls with life skills programme that build their health, social and economic assets through a Girls-centered programme. Through UNFPA support, the programme was implemented in 39 communities (Koinadugu 21; Kambia 8; and Pujehun 10) providing vulnerable adolescent girls with the right skills and information that built their confidence, enhancing their awareness on their sexuality, SRH and GBV issues. The girls acquired critical information about their sexual and reproductive health, enabling them to make informed decisions about their well-being. Through the safe space sessions, the girls gained essential life skills to navigate the physical and emotional changes of puberty. Additionally, the sessions equipped them with the knowledge and confidence to challenge discriminatory norms within their households and communities.The sessions were designed to foster positive shifts in attitudes and behaviors toward adolescent girls, particularly concerning their health, well-being, and education. The sessions provided a platform for the girls to actively engage their communities through drama, role-plays, skits, and open dialogues on the consequences of Child Marriage using knowledge gained from safe space sessions. Through this programme, 5,935 marginalized girls were reached with life skills and gender transformation programme which enabled them and their communities to reject Child Marriage and opt for education.

The education system in Mozambique has expanded considerably since the end of the civil war in 1992. Primary enrollment has more than tripled from 2000 to 2018, from just over 2 million to 6.5 million students in keeping with demographic pressures caused by population growth as well as commitments from the Millennium Development Goals, which rallied countries around universal access to basic education. However, rapid expansion of the system has meant trade-offs. There are obstacles to reinforcing existing building stock placed in disaster prone areas; parents and communities have built classrooms with local materials that cannot withstand the impact of the cyclical natural hazards. Thus, such structures suffer recurrent damage each year and pose a risk for the safety of children and teachers, all this underlines the need for stronger response to include safety standards during the recovery phase. This project aims to capitalize the efforts made by the MINEDH and the local communities of Sofala province to find improved solutions and safe learning spaces for children living in cyclone or flood prone areas  through adopting sustainable approaches that will break the vicious cycle of communities building schools that are then damaged in cyclical weather events, then rebuilt, then damaged and so on. _x000D_

However, technical assistance was provided during the preparation and conduct of internal training on gender mainstreaming in elections in the NEC.  

2). Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP) platform has been reassessed with recommendations for improvement, to ensure NEC resume work processes online. 

4). Support to CVE Cell: The establishment of NEC CVE Cells throughout the 73 electoral districts started with an Assessment Tour of selected counties to gauge the reaction of the locals, local government authorities, CSOs, CBOs, and FBOs on the new NEC CVE strategy ‚Äì bottom-to-top approach. Following the success of the Assessment, a Regional Consultation was launched and brought together stakeholders at a gathering to discuss findings from the Assessment Tour and how the new civic voter education approach can be used by the people, particularly at the community level. The Consultation proved successful. Hence, Recruitment Drive launched by the NEC for suitable CBOs that will make up the CVE cells. At the close of the exercise, 81 CBOs were certified for the initiative. Following the vetting of the CBOs, was Regional Training for 245 participants representing the qualified CBOs. With the conduct of the Training, the cells now stand on the brink of being fully established but with pending activities (national launch and signing of ‚Äòservice‚Äô contract).

5). To ensure institution capacity of NEC is strengthened, the following support was provided:
a). M&E: LESP hired a consultancy firm and trained 4 staff (2 women & 2 men) of the NEC M&E in results-based M&E, planning, implementation and results reporting writing. Last year, the M&E section benefitted from a training on workplan development, M&E planning and report writing organized by UNDP PMSU. The results-based M&E training was a refresher to enable the section adequately plan and monitor all electoral activities, collect data and report progress against NEC strategic plan towards achieving the desired results as NEC prepares to conduct the 2023 general elections. 
 
b). Strengthening security at NEC: LESP procured and installed CCTV camera around the perimeter of NEC compound, solar panel system and air conditioner as a means of strengthening security.  
c). Support to NEC Magisterial offices -	The project hired a company to conduct an assessment of the solar panel system at the 19 NEC magisterial offices across the country and provide maintenance services. 114 solar panel was procured and installed across NEC magisterial offices ahead of the 2023 general elections. All 19 NEC magisterial offices are electrified and operational   

d) Support to BRIDGE - BRIDGE    is    a    professional    development program with a particular focus on elections.  It is the most comprehensive curriculum and workshop package for elections that built the capacity of electoral institutions with the requisite knowledge and tool for improvement in electoral processes. To ensure effective and efficient electoral planning and management, LESP supported a month-long capacity building BRIDGE training program for 100 participants including NEC staff and other electoral actors. The aim of the training was to enhance the capacities of NEC staff and members of civil society organizations, in preparation for the 2023 Presidential and Legislative Elections. Previously, the project supported the training of 20 participants (12 NEC staff and 8 CSOs) and was certificated semi-workshop facilitators. 9 of the BRIDGE semi accredited, co-facilitated one of the BRIDGE modules on voter registration. This increased the facilitation skills of participants   

UN Women supported the capacity development of National Election Commission (NEC) Board of Commissioners as well as NEC magistrates and logistics officers 46 (14f/32m) on the NEC's Gender Policy, mainstreaming, the Elections Law section 4.5, and VAWiE/P and how to mainstream gender at all levels within the Commission. As a result, NEC is better positioned to hold political parties accountable for their legal obligations in the amended New Elections Law, and policy obligations including in the VAWIE/Protocol around women's participation.",16604000.0,13253030.09,11529016.26,-,794833.0,713878.26,595384.96,"UNDP:1. To ensure that the capacity of the NEC and other electoral stakeholders are strengthened in order to fulfil the mandate of the electoral process, in August 2022, UNDP-LESP trained 24 people (13 or 54% Male / 11 or 46% female), which comprised of key departmental staff of the NEC, magistrates and other electoral stakeholders, completed a module ‚ÄúTrain the facilitator‚Äù (TtF) in Building Resources in Democratic Governance and Election (BRIDGE). The training took place at the Farmington Hotel, Margibi County. Participants gained the requisite knowledge and skills to plan, organize and facilitate BRIDGE modules as were demonstrated during the training. In February 2023, 12 of the 24 BRIDGE trained participants facilitated three BRIDGE modules namely, Civic and Voter Education (CVE), Gender Integrity and Elections (GIE) and Voter Education (VR) to 150 people (80 or 53% male / 70 or 43% female) as a result of the BRIDGE TtF training knowledge gained in 2022. The 12 facilitators demonstrated professionalism, promoted inclusion of gender balance, maintained self-confidence and respect for diversity during their facilitations and were accredited as Semi-BRIDGE facilitators. As a result of this training, Building Institutional Excellence in Elections‚Äù NEC leadership is strengthened. NEC Communication and coordination strategies enhanced at all levels. Because of the training, NEC was able to identified bottlenecks and performance gaps during the biometric voter registration (BVR) process, and increased proficiency in the 2023 electoral operations. This capacity-building approach promoted ownership and sustainability of the electoral process.  To ensure wider coverage of CVE outreach, LESP, in partnership with NEC established and trained 81 CVE cells which comprised of 243 community-based organizations across the 73 electoral districts. The 243 CBOs robustly carried out CVE activities, ranging from CVE- BVR launch, county-to-county stakeholder engagements, town-hall meetings with community dwellers, door-to-door awareness, and sport tournaments across the country. Also, to compliment the work of CVE cells, as well as ensure robust CVE coverage, LESP awarded small grant to 8 civil society organizations (CSOs). The project procured over two hundred and fifty thousand, five hundred (250,500) pieces of CVE materials, including banners, leaflets, posters, information brochures which enhanced visibility of the CVE across the country. This approach attributed to the massive voter turnout during the October 10th General Elections. LESP strengthened the capacity of NEC 19 assistant magistrates and four regional coordinators on CVE related activities. CVE cells and CSOs experience cordiality and collaboration in their various roles which led to the positive outcome of a partially violence free elections. During 2023 implementing, NEC, supported by UNDP-LESP trained 76 temporary monitors (43 or 57 Male / 33 or 43% Female) and deployed them across the 19 magistrate offices during the biometric voter registration (BVR) period and on election day. The 76 election monitors, monitored and collected real-time evidenced-based information using Personal Data Assistant (PDA). This helped the NEC immediately resolved issues/changes that were impeding/stalling operations at various voter registration centers during the BVR process and at polling places on elections day. As a result, enhanced operational performances and ensured Integrity, Transparency, Inclusion, and Credibility of the 2023 General Presidential and Legislative Elections. CVE activities were monitored vigorously and feedback provided daily to the NEC addressed gaps in CVE outreaches, as well as improved CVE activities nation-wide. Based LESP capacity need assessment report, 7 NEC staff (4 male  3 female) capacity built in records management, research methods, and electronic archiving. In June 2023, the project procured two desktop computers, two scanners, one printer, archiving software and a mini-conference table. As a result, NEC digitized 20% of sensitive electoral documents. To ensure transparency and maintain credibility of the electoral process, 694 (167females / 527 males) political party agents were trained on the procedures of observing elections. This led to political parties putting in measures that prevented massive electoral fraud, especially during the November 14th runoff to avoid election malpractices. Trained over 3500 joint law enforcement officers as crowd control election security ahead of the October. The resulted to a partially violence free elections with no incident reported. The project also trained 35 persons representing organization of people living with disabilities and women civil society groups in proposal development and report writing. Because of this capacity building intervention, 5 organizations developed, received small grant and implemented a project each successfully. Additionally, 4 ( 2 disabilities and 2 women) organizations benefitted from UNDP CSOs grants and conducted civic and voter education.",1454259.0,1057961.5,873352.32,"UN Women, through the Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP), has supported the National Elections Commission (NEC) to strengthen gender responsiveness in electoral processes, particularly in collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated data (GDD) on voter turnout during the 2023 Presidential and Legislative Elections. This data, along with other GDD categories (election workers, observers, registered voters, and candidates), was retrieved from Final Registration Rolls across all 15 counties between April and June 2024, addressing gaps in Election Day records. The findings will be published in a gender assessment report in July 2024 and will inform future strategies to promote gender equality in elections. Furthermore, a comprehensive gender analysis of the 2023 elections is underway, led by a consultant and launched during an inception meeting in September 2024, involving 33 stakeholders (23 women, 10 men) from NEC, women‚Äôs organizations, and international partners. This analysis, which includes case studies from Grand Cape Mount, Nimba, and Grand Gedeh, highlights both successes and persistent barriers to women‚Äôs political participation and informs the development of an advocacy strategy for implementing temporary special measures and legal reforms to increase women‚Äôs representation. The NEC‚Äôs capacity to implement gender-responsive policies has been enhanced through UN Women‚Äôs technical assistance, including the development of a Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Policy, which fosters greater inclusion of women in leadership and electoral processes. These combined efforts mark significant progress toward addressing gender disparities in Liberia‚Äôs electoral framework and empowering women‚Äôs leadership.UNDP-LESP: The Building Resources in Democracy, Governance, and Elections (BRIDGE) program is an advanced, internationally recognized professional development initiative designed to strengthen electoral systems and build capacity in areas critical to the effective operation of Election Management Bodies (EMBs). As part of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Liberia Electoral Support Project‚Äîwhich is committed to enhancing the institutional effectiveness of the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia‚Äîa total of nineteen NEC staff members (comprising six women and thirteen men) successfully completed the BRIDGE Train the Facilitator course, conducted from 14 to 24 February 2024.After the training, two participants (one woman and one man) progressed to facilitate BRIDGE modules and were officially accredited as BRIDGE workshop facilitators, thereby contributing to the NEC‚Äôs broader objective of fostering sustainable internal capacity for electoral training and knowledge dissemination.In addition, to enhance the efficiency and accountability of financial management and reporting within institutions, particularly political parties, LESP-UNDP provided specialized training to 40 key representatives, including treasurers, financial secretaries, and senior officials from 32 registered political parties. The comprehensive training program focused on crucial topics such as financial management and reporting, the implementation of systems and controls, effective fundraising strategies, and best practices in accounting. This initiative aimed to bolster the capacity of political parties to meet the campaign finance regulations set by the National Election Commission (NEC), which came into effect on September 1st. As a direct result of this intervention, 63% of the 38 registered political parties successfully adhered to the NEC‚Äôs campaign finance reporting deadline, a significant improvement of 18 percentage points compared to the 45% compliance rate observed in the 2023 submissions.In collaboration with UN Women and the National Elections Commission (NEC), the Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP), supported by UNDP, conducted a comprehensive post-election review. This in-depth analysis aimed to uncover the reasons behind invalidated ballots and to evaluate voter participation through a gender-sensitive lens. The objective was to strengthen the integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness of Liberia's electoral process. The review encompassed data from 5,890 polling stations‚Äîrepresenting 99.7% of all polling places nationwide‚Äîspread across 2,080 precincts in 19 regions. As part of the process, the Final Registration Rolls (FRRs) were also thoroughly examined. A total of 1,846,582 voter records were analyzed, including 956,370 women and 890,212 men. This rich dataset provided valuable insights into gender dynamics in voter engagement and behavior during the election. The findings from this review will play a crucial role in shaping the NEC‚Äôs upcoming Strategic Plan for the period 2025‚Äì2030. By identifying areas for improvement and opportunities for greater inclusion, the plan will support more effective planning, administration, and management of future elections in Liberia.The LESP-UNDP provided critical support to the National Elections Commission (NEC) in conducting a comprehensive nationwide ""lessons learned"" initiative following the 2023 general elections. This activity convened a diverse group of 665 participants, including 415 men and 250 women, representing a broad cross-section of Liberian society. Attendees included representatives from local government authorities, traditional leaders, religious institutions, civil society organizations, election observation groups, members of the joint security forces, individuals living with disabilities, and other community stakeholders. The purpose of this inclusive forum was to conduct a thorough review of the operational and administrative aspects of the 2023 elections. Participants collaboratively assessed key achievements, identified ongoing challenges, and developed actionable recommendations aimed at strengthening future electoral processes. This consultative process not only reinforced transparency and accountability but also promoted broad-based participation, laying the foundation for sustained institutional learning and reform. Moreover, the collaborative efforts between LESP-UNDP and UN Women have yielded tangible progress in advancing inclusive governance. These initiatives have played a pivotal role in fostering more equitable and participatory decision-making, with a strong emphasis on empowering traditionally underrepresented groups‚Äîparticularly women, youth, and marginalized populations, to actively engage in the democratic process. By promoting inclusive political participation, these efforts contribute significantly to building a more representative and resilient democratic system in Liberia.To strengthen the institutional memory and enhance the long-term preservation of electoral documents, the UNDP-Liberia Electoral Support Project (UNDP-LESP) supported the National Elections Commission (NEC) by procuring two high-resolution digital scanners and two desktop computers. In parallel, the project outsourced the digitization and electronic archiving of all election-related documents to a local service provider, Duke Tech Solutions. The contract with the firm commenced on July 15, 2024. As of the reporting period, Duke Tech Solutions has completed approximately 95% of the digitization project. This includes the systematic sorting, high-quality scanning, and preliminary indexing of a comprehensive range of electoral materials. Consequently, the NEC has commenced accessing and managing documents via its newly established electronic archiving portal. This initiative represents a significant advancement in digital record-keeping, enabling more efficient retrieval, safeguarding critical electoral information, and contributing to institutional continuity.Before the elections, a pre public perception survey conducted showed that 66% of people trusted the National Elections Commission (NEC) to run fair elections. After the elections, the NEC, along with UNDP-Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP), UN Women, Democracy International (DI), the University of Michigan, and Stratcom, did another survey in May and June 2024. This new survey found that 91% of Liberians trust the NEC to hold free and fair elections. Still, there are big challenges in getting more women involved in politics. The survey, called ‚ÄúPublic Perceptions of Elections and Women‚Äôs Political Participation in Liberia,‚Äù was led by the NEC and supported by UNDP, LESP, the European Union, Irish Aid, and the Swedish Embassy. Liberia‚Äôs Business Start-up Center (BSC) carried out the survey with help from the other partners. They collected responses from 2,650 adults from all 15 counties. Results showed that 94% of people had a good experience on election day, and 88% trusted the new biometric voter registration system. But some problems remain: only 57% thought polling stations were easy to access for people with disabilities, and many said women still face challenges when trying to run for office. To help fix this, the NEC and UNDP are working on better Civic and Voter Education programs and removing barriers to participation. The positive feedback shows strong public trust and commitment to safe, fair elections. The survey gave helpful insights into what citizens think and showed areas where NEC can improve communication and outreach. It had a balanced group of participants‚Äî51% male and 49% female, 81% from cities, 19% from rural areas, and 9% were people with disabilities. As Liberia prepares for future elections, these findings show strong support for the NEC and highlight where more work is needed to include everyone in the democratic process",1566837.0,1327422.19,889495.0,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Invited participants for corrective actions meetings held in 13 regions included representatives of regional IMs, district officials and duty bearers from monitored facilities, who were able to commit to addressing key issues within their capacity or responsibility. During the period, there were no stockouts of 1st or 2nd line ART regimens, though cases of 3rd line ART regimen stockouts were registered especially in the Mbale Region and Jinja Region. The CLM consortium, CSOs and other community advocates/activists engaged key national level stakeholders and 3rd line stockouts were resolved. ‚óè       CLM feedback engagement meetings with the Implementing Partner and health facilities have influenced changes to service delivery, for example, at Mutolere HC III in Kisoro district where service users reported to sometimes miss clinic appointments because they could not afford to raise both transport fare and the 4,000 shillings the facility charged as a consultation fee. When the CLM project engaged the implementing partner (IP), UPMB, and facility staff to understand the purpose of the fee, the IP pledged to address the root cause of the consultation fee and requested abolition of this fee and consequently, in the period January‚ÄìMarch during clinic monitoring some clients reported to be happy because of the removal of the 4,000 shillings charge. One client was quoted saying, ‚ÄúI had asked to be transferred to Kisoro hospital because I sometimes could not afford transport to and from the facility alongside the consultation fee. But when I heard that the fee had been abolished, I asked to be transferred back here because there is no queue, and we normally get served on time‚Äù.

This type of data can inform policy and programming and also provide clear examples for social media authorities of where and how OVAW is proliferating so they can take urgent steps to end OVAW. Alternative data sources present a unique medium to gain insight on OVAW. The report was shared by UN Women with representatives from the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC), the Arab Network for Women in election, Libyan HoR members, Government representatives from Libya, Libyan Civil Society Organizations and activists, Arab EMBs and international community gained the knowledge on how web data can provide valuable insights on VAWG and opens up opportunities to build innovative alternative indicators to monitor incidents of OVAW during the ‚ÄúRegional Conference for Enhancing Women‚Äôs Participation in Elections‚Äù on 21 and 22 May 2023 in Tripoli, Libya. The results of the report were also shared with Meta‚Äôs human rights policy team to improve the reporting of incidents on the platform.Second, this year, international women‚Äôs day provided a great opportunity to shed light on the online violence that Libyan women are subjected to. Four Libyan women (1 activist, 1 political candidate, the head of women office and the head of women training centre in the ministry of interior) came together in a video to raise awareness about online violence, its different forms, its consequences, and how to end it.Sixteen Libyan women have had their capacities built and knowledge increased on digital security and reporting tools specific to Meta platforms. This was achieved through an online training session delivered by UN Women in collaboration with META on the 2nd of November 2023.The trainees were from diverse backgrounds and age categories, with 56.25% aged between 25 and 44 years old, 31.25% aged between 45 and 60 years old, 1 participant in the youth category aged 19 to 24 and 1 participant over 61 years of age.13 participants are volunteers affiliated with the High National Elections Commission, two are employees and 1 is the head of the women's office in Sebha.According to a pre-session survey, 48% of the registrants have expressed their desire to have a better understanding of the available tools on META to ensure the protection of women and public figures on the platform.  27% expressed interest in having increased knowledge on the reporting tools, while 24% were interested to know more about META‚Äôs community standards.68% registrants have expressed that they need to enhance their capacities on the safety tools on the META platforms, while 32% indicated having a moderate level of knowledge on the subject.According to the post training survey, 31% of the participants have indicated that they have gained sufficient new knowledge about the safety and security tools available on META, while 63% indicated that they still need more information. Only 1 person out of 16 have indicated that their knowledge level did not change following the session. Following the session, 63% of the participants indicated that they now feel more confident in their ability to protect themselves and others on META‚Äôs platforms using the new knowledge that they have received. 13% have reported no changed in their confidence level, while 25% indicated that they now feel more confused on how to us the new information they have obtained.The participants provided some comments and suggestions to increase the effectiveness of the training specifically on the need to hold the sessions in person due to internet cuts in multiple regions in Libya and to have a more practical training.UN Women contributed to this by gathering the participants, providing the training link alongside simultaneous interpretation and conducting the pre-and post session assessments. UN Women also ensured follow-up with the participants and META following the training. META contributed to this by providing two trainers from their regional office.

Two training sessions (virtual and in- person) have been completed successfully. The training acted as a springboard to build expertise on SRHR  GBV for Young People With Disabilities. The curriculum is expected to be rolled out globally in 2023. To ensure partners are well abreast with the progress of the programme, a successful joint monitoring visit was undertaken to Ngami district where Women Against Rape (WAR) is implementing CSE for in and out of school youth; and the youth programme is supporting delivery of youth friendly health services. Senior managers from the ministries of Health and Education together with UNFPA participated in the visit. Key stakeholders at district level implementing the programmes provided insights on progress including key challenges (Frequent stock out of reproductive health commodities; Lack of qualified staff to provide integrated SRH and HIV services, Long distance travelled to access youth friendly services; Incomplete abortion cases registered among young women due to the lack of accessibility of preferred contraceptives; and High prevalence of teenage pregnancy among adolescent girls). As the programme comes to a close, two key actions agreed upon included a) Convening a dialogue with relevant stakeholders on best approaches for elimination of harmful cultural practices such as child marriage and UNFPA, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education and Skills development will develop a sustainability plan for the SYP programmes since it is at its final stage of implementation. UNFPA supported the Botswana Association for the Blind and Partially Sighted (BAPS) to implement Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) for in and out of school youth institutions for young people with visual impairment. The programme is implemented in four educational institutions serving young people with disabilities. These are: Kgatleng district (Pudulogong Rehabilitation and Development Trust; Mochudi Resource Centre for the Blind  Linchwe Junior Secondary School) and Francistown (Lephoi Centre for the Blind). To ensure delivery of quality CSE, a monitoring visit was undertaken to two institutions (Pudulogong  Mochudi Resource Centre for the Blind) in Kgatleng district.

Gaps identified by the 10 Country report in 2010 were also validated or confirmed by the consultancy that facilitated this process and they were closed. These included the following:The concept of gender was not well integrated in the Life Skills CurriculumSome content that should have been started at lower classes in schools was started late in the school meaning that it could impact negatively on health outcomes.Delivery of CSE or Life Skills to learners was not effective as some teachers expressed inability to deliver CSE. All these gaps have been integrated in to the curriculum through a very successful collaborative and inclusive process. ,35000.0,29975.37,25174.53,-,35000.0,25966.63,24593.7,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Improved safety of the learning environment resulted from new WASH facilities. Evidence from UNICEF‚Äôs Dropout Study, a Public Expenditure Review and the Transforming Education Summit were successfully used to find strategies for addressing the learning and access crises.ÔªøImportant progress towards availability of ECD/ECE policy frameworks to ensure holistic ECD service delivery has been made this year with UNICEF support. A high-level meeting (the second ECD roundtable) took place in February 2022, resulting in an Action Plan with the following main objectives: (i) Development of National ECD Policy and strategy for its implementation, including establishment of a coordination mechanism between all ECD sectors/stakeholders to ensure holistic ECD service delivery; (ii) Development and implementation of the National ECE Strategy.  Progress has also been made to ensure a school environment free of violence. MINEDH approved the operational plan for the Violence Against Children (VAC) referral and reporting mechanism and disseminated the VAC brochure to more than 2,100 gender and health focal points and 22,800 students. Furthermore, 400 (260 women) gender and school health focal points at school, district and province levels and the Multisectoral VAC Mechanism group increased awareness of the mechanism through UNICEF trainings. In addition, 600 gender and school health focal point teachers (310 female) in Nampula were trained on psychosocial support and Menstrual Hygiene Management to protect and guide children that are victims of VAC, Gender Based-Violence, and emergencies, benefiting approximately 19,250 children. Improved safety of the learning environment resulted from new Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities constructed in UNICEF target districts. In Cabo Delgado, 148 sanitation blocks were completed. In Nampula, water supply facilities were completed in 41 schools, surpassing the target by 30. 20 of those schools also received a total of 60 Sanitation blocks with handwashing facilities, with ongoing construction of an additional 39 blocks in 13 schools. In Sofala, 6 schools benefitted from new water supply facilities and ongoing Construction of 18 Sanitation blocks with handwashing facilities. Finally, water supply facilities were completed in 46 Schools in Zambezia, significantly surpassing the target of 15 schools. Construction of 45 Sanitation blocks in 15 schools is ongoing.  Evidence from different studies, including the 2019 Dropout Study, indicates that increased community and parent engagement in school management can help reduce student dropout. UNICEF has used this evidence to advocate with MINEDH and partners to prioritize strengthening the capacity of school councils (SC) to create an enabling environment for learning with lower dropout. As a result of this advocacy, MINEDH has expanded financing of SC activities in its action plan (PdA) and scaled up the implementation of two new SC training guides on: (i) how to identify and refer cases of VAC to different institutions, and (ii) how to integrate cross-cutting issues, including emergency preparedness and response, VAC, school readiness and COVID-19 prevention in their daily work. 96 school councils (2,160 SC members including 950 women) in UNICEF target districts were trained on the use of the two SC guides and a SC toolkit. UNICEF Mozambique is also providing support to MINEDH to conduct a national evaluation of the SC programme, whose results will be used to define strategies and planning for MINEDH.",3745000.0,2932482.4,2177102.21,"Evidence from different studies, including UNICEF‚Äôs 2021 Dropout Study ‚ÄúAvalia√ß√£ao Longitudonal de Desist√™ncia Escolar‚Äù - (currently being finalized) , indicates that increased community and parent engagement in school management can help reduce student dropout. UNICEF has used this evidence to advocate with MINEDH and partners to prioritize strengthening of school councils‚Äô capacity to create an enabling environment for learning with lower dropouts. In 2023 UNICEF supported MINEDH in conducting the School Council evaluation and to advocate with MINEDH to use an evidence-based approach for programming. The results showed that all the schools in the country have established the School Councils, and they are functioning but there is still room for improvements on aspects such as: planning process; participation of women; election of members and to ensure that members monitor and follow up learning process systematically and report to community on learning achievements. In 2023, UNICEF continued to advocate for foundational literacy and numeracy through the accelerator programme as this is both a global and domestic issue and, Mozambique is much worse than the global (4.9% on reading competency against 40% at global level).
