Findings and recommendations: South Sudan does not criminalize participation in an organized criminal group in its Penal Code. With respect to limitation periods, there do not seem to be any provided for in the anti-money laundering (AML) Act. Therefore, the limitation period found in s. 47 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 2008 (‚ÄúCCP Act‚Äù) would apply and it provides for a limitation period of five years. South Sudan also needs to establish competent AML investigative units that would have a duty to cooperate with the financial intelligence unit (FIU). With respect to criminalization of corruption, there is no specific reference in the Penal Code to offences applying to foreign officials. The Southern Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2009, indicates that it applies to international non-government organizations (section 4(3)), but there is no specific mention of foreign officials or international civil servants.
