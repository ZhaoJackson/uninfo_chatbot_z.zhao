This was commonly highlighted by students from rural areas attending coding training in community day services. This demonstrates their confidence in explaining and utilising the skills and knowledge gained from the project.Innovative digital solutions: 122 girls and young women who participated in 3 regional coding bootcamps utilized the knowledge and skills gained by developing different innovations. These innovations are expected to enable the developers earn income out of their innovations or unlock opportunities for their employment. For example, a who led the development of the smart greenhouse technology which has been adopted by Mzuzu University and Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources as a prototype has been given a masters scholarship that she is currently undertaking at the Mzuzu University.UNICEF Key Achievements: UNICEF made significant strides in supporting alternative learning pathways and delivering transferable skills to out-of-school adolescents. Through the Complementary Basic Education (CBE) program, 8,993 learners (4,179 girls) across 28 districts and 204 centers were provided foundational literacy and numeracy skills, enabling a streamlined transition to formal primary schools. Additionally, a nine-month functional literacy program established 178 centers in Dedza, Kasungu, Mangochi, and Salima districts, enrolling 12,630 adolescents (9,620 girls) and training 900 village literacy committee members to promote and manage informal learning. To further equip adolescents with essential skills, 2,342 young people (1,207 girls) received entrepreneurship training through the National Youth Council of Malawi. Capacity-building initiatives trained 360 adolescents as mental health champions and engaged others in climate action, fostering leadership and resilience. These programs not only expand learning opportunities but also empower adolescents to develop skills critical for their reintegration into education and the workforce, promoting sustainable development. In collaboration with the Malawi University of Science and Technology and with support from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, UNICEF facilitated awareness-building on climate change and its impacts, benefiting 559 youth (302 female) from underrepresented backgrounds in six flood-prone districts in the South and empowering 100 children and youth aged 12 to 24 (60 female) with entrepreneurial and innovation skills to create climate solutions for their communities.Challenges: Low retention rates in educational programs amongst adolescents.Opportunities and Priorities: Expand mentorship program and integrate mobile or remote learning solutions.UNFPA Achievements: In 2024, UNFPA's support reached 89,630 adolescents and girls through the Safe Spaces and mentorship programmes, and 10,869 adolescents and women through livelihood programmes integrating socio-economic empowerment and SRHR. Innovation and digital solutions for Life Skills and Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) were applied and scaled such as in-school CSE using digital tablets and apps; a total of 31,301 adolescents benefited from the support.

Additionally, over 100 TVET teachers and administrators from project schools have been sensitized on gender and inclusion issues. In the Southeast region, the project has provided accommodation for 36 vulnerable girls who live far from school, to enable them to stay in school and concentrate on their studies. Moreover, the project has initiated a community-based awareness activity through CSOs that fosters a mutually beneficial relationship between schools and their communities, ultimately creating a safer learning environment. Through methods like jingles, radio talk shows, drama, and sports at public forums, more females and vulnerable young individuals have enrolled in TVE trade programs. Notably, in some cases, out-of-school youth, such as motorbike riders have registered for afternoon trade sessions at institutions like ZMHS. Furthermore, the project collaborates with at-risk youth engaged in drug and substance abuse, encouraging them to undergo detox and rehabilitation to facilitate their enrollment in TVE institutions.",3736008.0,3311749.04,2887231.93,"UNIDO Youth Rising: The Youth Rising Project made strides in mainstreaming inclusion by improving access to TVET, especially for young girls, enhancing training delivery conditions (TVET teachers and infrastructure), and integrating inclusive principles into its communication strategies. Key achievements include: Free accommodation was provided to 36 female students in southeastern operational precisely at the Zwedru Multilateral High School in Grand Gedeh. 65% of instructors across 10 TVET institutions were trained in inclusive education principles, including preventing sexual harassment and gender-based violence. To support inclusion mainstreaming efforts, the Youth Rising project continued to deliver an integrated communications strategy through social media and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).  Youth Rising continued to engage its 10, 500+ followers on Facebook by addressing themes such as advocating for female enrolment, providing safety advice, showcasing home-grown talent from TVET skills competitions, challenging stereotypes, and promoting TVET as an educational pathway for employment as Liberia industrializes. Youth Rising--supported CSOs also delivered messages targeting inclusion to over 65,000 community members through radio jingles, dramas, sports events, and youth-friendly campaigns. These initiatives aim to rebrand TVET programs, encouraging young women and girls to explore male-dominated trades. Short-term training programs will be offered to out-of-school youth across the 10 operational TVET schools.UNICEF supported a community-based program that provided soft vocational and technical skills training for vulnerable adolescents in Montserrado (West Point and New Kru Town). 150 adolescents (125 girls, 25 boys) graduated from various vocational skills training including cosmetology, pastry making, tailoring, hotel management, and hospitality services. After the theoretical training, which lasted for 6 months, and subsequent 3 months of internships, 85% of the graduates received business kits to start their own businesses, while 7% (25 adolescents) secured jobs and 8% (30 adolescents) accessed internships.

This not only equips young people for the workforce but also injects a skilled talent pool of over 586 individuals into the economy, benefitting employers seeking qualified workers.Moreover, UNDP recognizes the importance of inclusivity. Their programs extend beyond gender, reaching into the informal business sector where a significant number of women play a pivotal role.  Over 49% (approximately 6,442 women) gained access to essential services and financial resources alongside 51% (approximately 6,704 men).

Specifically:200 youth (67% male, 33% female) received training as solar technicians, equipping them with skills for employment in the renewable energy sector.100 youth (84% female, 16% male) were trained in bag-making, enabling them to engage in cross-border trade and small-scale manufacturing‚Äã.These efforts contribute to Nigeria's sustainable energy transition while simultaneously expanding employment opportunities in green jobs and local manufacturing.Challenges and Corrective ActionsWhile vocational training programs have yielded positive results, certain challenges remain:Limited financial resources for business expansion, making it difficult for trained youth to scale their ventures.Infrastructure challenges, particularly in areas with limited access to electricity and digital connectivity.Security concerns in conflict-affected regions, which limit access to training facilities and employment opportunities.To address these issues, UNDP is working to:Expand financial inclusion and micro-credit access for youth entrepreneurs, enabling them to leverage vocational skills for sustainable livelihoods.Strengthen partnerships with the private sector, creating direct employment pathways for trained youth.Enhance access to digital tools and e-commerce platforms, allowing youth to market their products and services beyond their immediate communities‚Äã.Way ForwardLooking ahead, UNDP aims to scale up vocational training programs by integrating digital skills, financial literacy, and business management training.

A comprehensive capacity needs assessment highlighted critical gaps, including a lack of technical knowledge on climate-smart agriculture, financial barriers to adopting climate technologies, and gender norms restricting women's participation. The assessment recommended targeted interventions such as climate-smart training, capital grants, and strengthening district staff in climate change and disaster management. At the district level, challenges such as poor coordination and limited funding were identified, with recommendations for better staff training and improved departmental coordination.The gender analysis showed how traditional roles limited women's involvement in climate initiatives, underlining the need for gender-sensitive programming. MECC awareness-raising sessions were conducted to educate communities about the intersections of migration, environment, and climate change, identifying strategies like planting drought-resistant crops and enforcing deforestation bye-laws. The project also focused on community preparedness, offering financial management training and introducing a revolving fund to ensure sustainable support for local groups. A total of 26 groups developed climate-smart business plans, aligning with local development goals and strengthening monitoring mechanisms.The project supported climate-smart initiatives through a cash transfer program, disbursing UGX 65,000,000 to 26 community groups to implement sustainable practices such as apiary, cereal banking, and goat rearing. The cash transfer process was transparent, with the involvement of local leaders and community groups ensuring effective use of funds. Successes included recommendations for continued support to develop value chains, facilitate exchange visits, and improve market access through better roads.

In addition, the capacities of 578 refugee and host community women and girls were enhanced through vocational and livelihood skill development in Kakuma, Kalobeyei Integrated settlement and Dadaab, through UN Women interventions. The skills training included tailoring and dress making, art and craft production, tie and die, henna decoration, soap-making and baking. In addition, 804 women survivors were incorporated to women‚Äô Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA) and received training on group savings and business development to strengthen their economic capacities and self-reliance. This is expected to enhance income and socio-economic livelihoods of women households and communities. It is envisaged that the vocational and livelihoods skills will improve women‚Äôs ability to earn an income and elevated their status within the family.

An additional, 525 women supported by UN Women in Kakuma became members of seven Community Policing and Protection Team (CPPT) in all the refugee communities 5 which was previously dominated by 56,400 male members before the intervention. The CPPT is managed by the Department of Refugee Services under the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government as a way of promoting local ownership of security in refugee camps in Kenya. The increase of women representation in security meetings contributed to the developing practical approaches to addressing insecurity including introducing patrols that include women during the early mornings and evenings along the paths that school children use and those used for firewood collection

Increased Access to Effective Services & Protection Mechanisms Through Social Spaces in Refugee and Host Communities: 3,724 GBV survivors from the refugee and host communities benefitted from protection services, which included clinical care, medical screening, psychosocial counselling, dignity kits, referrals, legal aid and representation at law courts. Access to justice for 634 GBV survivors were improved, of which 7 cases led to convictions. 

3,940 vulnerable women and out-of-school girls have increased knowledge and skills on enhancing their resilience as a means of empowering them and reducing GBV cases.
395,840 community members reached through a series of advocacy campaigns to prevent and end GBV, leading to increased awareness on referral pathways, improved reporting of GBV cases within 72 hours and inclusion of women in community security meetings.

This was achieved through awareness-raising on HIV prevention in Montserrado, Bong, and Margibi Counties respectively. 
UNHCR provided sensitization and awareness raising support to communities in four counties and also provided supplements and food to HIV patients.
The National HIV Strategic Plan (2021 ‚Äì 2025)‚Äôs Target 3 aims at scaling-up HIV combination prevention to reach 90% of the general population with a focus on key and vulnerable populations.  The UN contributed to this target, with close to 250,000 young people provided with HIV including comprehensive sexuality education and SRHR services. Of these, over 210,000 utilized integrated youth friendly SRHR services from supported health facilities and outreach sites, with 55% of them young people aged between 10 to 24 years. A total of 966 teachers from 331 schools from 5/15 counties were trained on comprehensive sexuality education. As a result, 10,118 (6,854 females and 3,264 males) school-going young people benefited from CSE. School health clubs were also targeted, with 14 schools supported, reaching over 1,200 young people. For the community component, 12 women-led organizations (CBOs) were trained and empowered to provide mentorship and sexuality education to out-of-school adolescents using an out of school manual, with close to 30,000 out-of- school youths (marketers, motorbike and kehkeh riders) reached. Also, behavioral change education to close to 2,000 women and adolescent girls was provided. The National Youth Policy and Action Plan including the Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) Facilitator Manuals was finalized and disseminated.
UNESCO under UNAIDS programme organized two weeks awareness campaign against HIV/AIDS by mobilizing teachers, adolescent students and youth in the school and at the community level. The campaign has successfully reached to 935 teachers and young people. The programme also provided Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE)  in schools during the campaign.

In 2024, through a joint initiative with the National Institute of Statistics, UNICEF was a main contributor in the development of the administrative data collection manual and its operational plan which will enhance the data ecosystem. Four working sessions with 25 public services institutions promoted interoperability of the different data and systems including on CRC monitoring, climate and disability, using an equity lens. These tools will be key to improve reliable child-centred disaggregated data collection supporting the monitoring of child rights and the SDG, advancing progress towards UNSDCF Outcome-4.

UN Women. In a significant stride towards economic empowerment and financial inclusion, the collaborative efforts of UN Women, Orange, and the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) have culminated in a remarkable achievement for rural women in Liberia. Over 1,200 women residing in the rural counties of Lofa, Bong, and Nimba have been granted access to rural credit and financial services. This initiative is not merely a provision of funds; it is a catalyst for sustainable development within the agricultural sector, which is a cornerstone of the Liberian economy.The inception of Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) has been a pivotal element in this success story. These associations serve as grassroots financial institutions where rural women can save their earnings, borrow capital, and invest in their agricultural ventures. The integration of VSLAs with the formal financial sector is a groundbreaking step that bridges the gap between informal savings mechanisms and formal banking services. It ensures that the financial activities of these rural women are recognized by the formal economy, thus opening doors to larger credit lines and investment opportunities.The impact of this integration is profound. It empowers women to take an active role in the agricultural value chain, from production to marketing, thereby fostering investment and growth in this vital sector. As a result, women are not only able to improve their own economic stability but also contribute significantly to the overall development of their communities. The enhanced financial autonomy leads to an elevation in their standards of living, with ripple effects that extend to better education for their children, improved healthcare, and stronger resilience against economic shocks.This achievement is a testament to the power of collaborative efforts in driving social change and economic progress. It underscores the importance of financial literacy and access to credit as essential tools for empowering women, particularly in rural settings where such opportunities are often scarce. The success of the VSLAs and their integration with the formal financial sector in Liberia serves as an inspiring model for similar initiatives globally, aiming to uplift women and strengthen the agricultural backbone of economies.IFAD: Results obtained under this component include:1. Provision of 79 power tiller sets for reduction of labor and expansion of cultivated land areas;2. Provision of 25 rice mills and their accessories for value addition, reduction of post-harvest losses and increase income for rice producers. As part of community contribution, a total of 23 mini rice processing centers have been constructed by the beneficiaries. 3. Provision of 20 water pump machines to 20 women groups comprising of 200 households that geared towards enhancing sustainable and continuous vegetable production; 4. Provided a minimum US$2,800 which enhanced the capacity land clearing, field layout and other production activities;5. The provided 24 heavy duty motorbikes to the 15 cooperative in Nimba and Lofa geared towards enhancing the operational activities including outreach and aggregation of cocoa beans from clustered communities in the districts;From the sales of these cocoa, the cooperative have increase their income to US$725,307.00.6.

The program has also fostered economic empowerment by providing women with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in sustainable agricultural practices, increasing productivity and income generation. The capacity building was delivered through literacy skills classes, which have played a crucial role in empowering these women. By improving their literacy skills, the women have gained access to critical information and resources that support their agricultural endeavors and overall economic empowerment. This increased literacy has also facilitated greater participation in decision-making processes related to land ownership and agricultural investments.

Beyond providing market opportunities for farmers, beneficiary SMEs also support farmers to increase their productivity through linkages to address market access challenges for farmers. Further supports provided to cooperatives include the supplied 8 desktop computers, 8 printers and 8 saves.  UNDP: During the period under review, VSLAs provided access to savings and flexible micro-loans, which supported income-generating activities such as food processing, tailoring, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly crafts. These enterprises created alternative income sources, reduced dependency on forest resources, and strengthened community resilience. Additionally, the initiative to enhance rural capital for women and youth groups has significantly contributed to building sustainable livelihoods in vulnerable community forest areas. By providing access to small micro-enterprise investment and supporting the formation of Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs), the project empowered marginalized groups to take charge of their economic future. In 2024, the UNDP through its Accelerated Community Development Programme (ACDP) supported 14 farmers' cooperatives with a total membership of 725 (435 women, 290 men). In an effort to empower the selected agricultural cooperatives and facilitate their growth towards becoming viable and vibrant entities, the ACDP, in collaboration with the Growth Accelerator project, disbursed the amount of USD$20,000.00 to each of the 14 agricultural cooperatives amounting to the total of USD$280,000.00 as start-up business grants. These grants are intended to support their early-stage operations and growth. The grants are being used to address specific priorities identified by the agricultural cooperatives pertinent to their growth.

These three platforms allow rural women to discuss challenges associated with their rights to land ownership, especially related to inheritance. In addition, 52% of members of land ADR mechanisms now have adequate knowledge and skills in land conflict prevention and mediation as well as the protection of women's land rights. This is a result of several training sessions held between October and December 2024 with these structures in Grand Gedeh, Nimba, and Gbarpolu Counties. OHCHR supported the establishment and maintenance of early warning and early response mechanisms following the general elections in 2024. The Office, under the UN Peacebuilding Fund Peaceful Election Project in August, supported two regional trainings with participants from Bomi, Bong, Lofa, and Nimba counties, focusing on lessons learned from the 2023 general elections and putting in strategies for mitigating post-election conflict, targeting youth, women-based Community Watch Teams (CWTs), and local authorities. Respect for human rights was emphasized under the guidance of INCHR and state authorities for the 2024 election. A total of 66 participants, including 24 women, attended the two training sessions, and this led to an improved knowledge of participants on how to assess whether an election is credible, essential to democracy, peaceful, free, fair, and transparent. This contributed to the successful conduct of the Liberia election without any major conflict.Also in August, OHCHR provided technical and financial support to the National Elections Commission, the Liberia National Police, and the Independent National Commission on Human Rights for the organization of two phases of one-day regional dialogues in Monrovia, Ganta, Buchanan, and Zwedru. These dialogues focused on conflict prevention, human rights monitoring, and community policing in the post-election context. The dialogues also brought together 283 participants, including 126 women. The dialogue provided a platform for participants were reflected on the human rights concerns highlighted in OHCHR Liberia's report regarding the 2023 general elections and run-off. At the end of the dialogue, the participants gained knowledge on post-election management which enabled them engaged with their peers, and community members in terms of managing conflict and addressing human rights concerns raised. This knowledge gained also helped to control and manage conflict during and after the 2024 election.Furthermore, October, OHCHR, in collaboration with the National Elections Commission (NEC) and INCHR, conducted a two-day dialogue with NEC magistrates and technical staff from the 15 counties on the lessons learned from the 2023 general and presidential elections. The dialogue was held in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, and aimed at reviewing and assessing the implementation of OHCHR's recommendations from the report issued by the Office in August 2024 on human rights in the electoral context and served help NEC magistrates, and technical staff to gained in-depth knowledge on the effects of violating human rights on the Country as a whole. Forty people, including seven women, attended the dialogue. In other occasion in October, OHCHR provided technical support to INCHR and NEC for the organization of a two-day dialogue in Monrovia with policymakers' stakeholders, government and civil society organizations. This dialogue reviewed recommendations from previous regional sessions held in Monrovia concerning the violation of human Rights during period. These various dialogues and advocacy meetings improved the knowledg4e of key actors' that serve as agent of change in those communities and finally through the awareness-raising programs on ECOWAS radio and through various media channels, including call-in talk shows, jingles, and online platforms like Facebook, content on human rights issues was shared where people benefited from these programs by learning how to manage conflict. This resulted in a fair, peaceful, and transparent election in Liberia without any violent incidents reported.UNDP in 2024, Conducted capacity building trainings for Community Land Development Management Committees (CLDMCs) in the Bomi, Cape Mount and Nimba to augment their roles, responsibilities, and functions as it relates to their workings for communities that are already at the CLDMC levels.Conduct community profiling exercise and Community engagement of the selected communities.

UN Women, in partnership FAO, 14 manuals  for the training of trainers (ToT) on women‚Äôs leadership skills, financial literacy, agribusiness, value chain development, agronomy, livestock production, and nutrition-sensitive agriculture were developed and used for training. Furthermore, the capacity of 30 agricultural extension officers (11 females and 19 males) on gender-responsive CSA practices was increased following a series of ToT training workshops, which were organized in partnership with the county government specialists. Finally, UN Women facilitated stakeholder meetings in four counties (Uasin Gichu, Taita Taveta, Meru, Nakuru, Embu) to obtain input on gender policies in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture.

In 2022. UN Women, in collaboration with FAO, grew the capacity and skills of 1,833 farmers (Female: 1,471, Male: 362) in Kitui, Laikipia and West Pokot counties on the utilization of gender-sensitive CSA technologies and practices. Furthermore, among the 1,833 farmers, UN Women strengthened the capacity of 697 women farmers from 27 Business Savings Groups (BSGs) in West Pokot in basic financial literacy and started group saving. It is expected that the farmers increased their understanding of 1) how to save, manage credit and share out and the associated records for each, 2) how to select a profitable business based on season, market, skills, available resources and profit and how to have multiple income-generating activities throughout the year to bring constant income. Based on the latest business progress survey conducted in West Pokot County, 27 BSGs have saved a total of USD 41,847. This translates to an average of USD 1,550 per group. Furthermore, UN Women through its Women‚Äôs Economic Empowerment through Climate-Smart Agriculture (WEE-CSA) programme has strengthened the county government partners‚Äô awareness and understanding of gender-responsive CSA policies in Kitui, Laikipia and West Pokot counties. Each county government has mapped available national policies and strategies on CSA and climate change adaptation (CCA) against their existing county-level policies and strategies, as well as come up with a policy-making processes roadmap to facilitate their adoption. With UN Women‚Äôs ongoing technical support, it is expected that the government will accommodate and internalise the gender-responsive CSA budgeting in their next five-year County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) at the county level by the end of 2022. Moreover, UN Women supported the capacity building of 360 women in three counties (Kitui and Laikipia: 6 groups with 116 women, West Pokot: 4 groups with 100 women) in the policy and budget formulation, implementation at the county level, and their roles in implementation monitoring/tracking and how they can go about to hold the county government accountable. In Laikipia and Kitui counties, 102 women engaged in County Public Participation Forums on the budget estimates for FY 2022/2023 and 6 women participated in the development process of the Laikipia Rangeland Policy. 5 memoranda representing farmer priorities were submitted in Laikipia county petitioning the county government to consider women development priorities in the budget cycle. In West Pokot County, the women trained are expected to be mobilised to participate in and influence the upcoming county planning and fiscal policy development processes i.e CIDP and Annual Development Plan (ADP) development process.

These groups received training in financial literacy, business management, and climate-smart agriculture, promoting sustainable livelihoods.Faith-based organizations and traditional leaders were pivotal in promoting social behavior change and safeguarding child rights. Chiefs and community leaders were engaged to address harmful practices such as child marriage, aligning cultural norms with child protection goals. UNICEF also leveraged youth networks to disseminate messages on gender equity, education, and protection services, empowering young people to become agents of change in their communities.Through partnerships with local and faith-based organizations, UNICEF supported community policing and psychosocial interventions in cyclone-affected regions, reaching over 600,000 children and caregivers.

From January to June 2023, UNFPA successfully reached 80,133 young people through life skills education, demonstrating its commitment to the empowerment of adolescents and youth. Life skills education enables young people to enhance their health, social, and economic assets, while also enabling them to participate meaningfully in decision-making and peace-building processes at all levels.UNFPA has focused on implementing key interventions that facilitate young people's access to and utilization of SRH information and services. These interventions include strengthening youth development platforms, with a particular emphasis on young people living with HIV and disabilities, female sex workers, workers in mega projects, and domestic workers. UNFPA has tailored information, education, and behavior change communication (IE/BCC) dissemination to suit the specific needs of these target groups. Additionally, UNFPA has worked on capacitating service outlets to provide comprehensive SRH services and ensure their availability.One of the primary interventions implemented by UNFPA has been the expansion of youth development platforms, which serve as important sources of information and linkages to SRHR. These platforms include youth centers, sports and art clubs, schools, community care coalitions (CCCs), drop-in centers (DICs), and associations for adolescents living with HIV and disabilities. Special attention has been given to these platforms, particularly associations, youth centers, and networks that cater to young people with special needs. In total, 40 platforms were capacitated and made operational, enabling the delivery of out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) with tailored interventions for the identified target groups. As a result, 953 sex workers and young people with disabilities were reached through standardized social and behavior change communication (SBCC) sessions, designed in accordance with international guidance on out-of-school CSE. The DIC for sex workers and the DPO for young people with disabilities were also capacitated to provide friendly SRHR services and facilitate linkages to other health facilities.Phase four of the Joint programme on right based approach on adolescent and youth development promotes the development and empowerment of the most-at-risk adolescents and young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years by promoting SRH right, gender-based violence prevention and response and gender equality through system strengthening and knowledge/ skill building of the young people.

Through the research, it was possible to identify young people‚Äôs fears, hopes, needs and priorities conflict-affected settings. The research findings are used during programme design and implementation.Service provisions - key achievements ‚Ä¢            Through support provided to 48 adolescents and youth-friendly platforms, the knowledge and life skills of more than 45,500 adolescents and youth has been built to make informed choice and healthy SRH decisions to protect them from HIV, violence, abuse and exploitation.‚Ä¢            A total of 22,837 (6,332 females whenever sex - -disaggregated data was reported) young people have been provided with different services including contraception, HIV testing and counselling, STI screening and treatment, safe abortion, integrated SGBV services, mental health, psychological support and financial support to be enrolled in community -based health insurance schemes to get access to free primary health care services including SRH.‚Ä¢            Child and social protection, education, health and other relevant systems and services to deliver a minimum evidence-based package of interventions to reach the most vulnerable adolescents and youth.

In 2024, the National Assembly advanced discussions on gender-responsive constitutional and electoral reforms, informed by insights from study missions and legislative interactions, which increased understanding and commitment by members of the Joint Senate and House Committees on Constitutional and Electoral Matters to include affirmative action provisions in constitutional amendments. Notably, stakeholders at the North-West Zonal Legislative Interactive session jointly submitted a memorandum advocating for the creation of reserved seats for women and reforms to enhance the inclusivity of electoral processes. Further, at the national level, high-level advocacy led to tangible commitments towards adopting constitutional gender quotas and the provision of special seats for persons with disabilities in elective and appointive positions. Key stakeholder forums and convenings, such as the National Citizens Summit, the Speakers' Conference, and the Conference of Persons with Disabilities, resulted in resolutions to prioritize these critical reforms. Further, the conference of speakers, comprising leaders from all 36 state houses of assembly, committed to prioritizing the passage of the Gender Equality Opportunities Bill (GEOB) by 2025, reinforcing political will for inclusive governance.

Subsequently, the MIA developed draft project documents for the partner agreement which includes the implementation of this activity. This has helped to sensitize and create consensus around the project implementation which will contribute to local ownership and commitment, increasing the likelihood of successful project adoption and sustainability. This initiative has started following the change of the government after 2023, and the appointment of Ministers and Deputy and Assistant Ministers in April 2024, the delay in appointment has cause a delay also in the implementation of the PBF supported signed with the MIA in 2023.Meanwhile, UN Women has developed a term of reference for a consultant to support gender analyses and provide technical assistance to the MIA to mainstream gender and inclusion in the County Development Agendas (CDAs), which will support not only CDAs but also feed into the new national development plan.The next step is the appraisal process and agreement signing and implementation of the activity will commence in Q3.Q4: As part of the project ‚ÄúEmpowering citizens and communities to foster social accountability and transparency in governance and public service delivery,‚Äù UN Women developed a checklist and simple gender marker to analyze the County Development Agendas (CDAs) and facilitated a working session with partners Center for Transparency and Accountability in Liberia (CENTAL), Women‚Äôs NGO Secretariat of Liberia (WONGOSOL) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA). Using the checklist and draft CDA, UN Women assessed one CDA as a sample, using the GESI checklist to identify areas where gender and inclusion considerations were lacking. This analysis highlighted several gaps, including the need to specify how to strengthen the meaningful participation and representation of women, youth, and marginalized groups in the decision-making structures per the LGA. To address these gaps, UN Women facilitated a training on the checklist/mainstreaming gender in the CDAs with CENTAL, WONGOSOL and MIA on 10 October, 2024, at CENTAL‚Äôs office and again with the MIA, MGCSP, and MFDP 8 November 8 at MIA (See activity LBR_D_1.2.6.15 on roll out of the training for citizens).MIA then sponsored the participation of 11 additional women and youth participants, assuring greater gender balance in the validation, which was a significant improvement from the consultation workshops where women were underrepresented at just 23% of participants on average. However, in the validation consultation workshop, women made up 35% while youth made up an average of 22% of the participants. This helped improve compliance with the Local Government Act (LGA and targeted interventions as specified in ¬ß5.3 (vi.) of the LGA requiring the CDAs to include ‚ÄúSpecial programs for youths, women and children, people with disabilities and minority groups‚Äù. The effectiveness of this intervention was demonstrated during a monitoring mission that UN Women carried out in Bomi and Gbarpolu Counties on November 10th-14th during the CDA validation process. UN Women supported the process by developing a monitoring tool to assess women‚Äôs and youth consultation in the process.https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wHx6UWlN12XTe8UrpSzTFuuHP1SmqWg975XbE-50Bx0/editThe five-day training workshop (from 9- 13 December 2024), held in Bopolu City, Gbarpolu County, and Gbarnga, Bong County, marked the official launch of County Development Planning Units (DPUs) in six pilot counties: Bong, Lofa, Bomi, Gbarpolu, Grand Bassa, and Nimba. This milestone follows the validation of the County Development Agendas (CDAs) in the counties by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), setting the stage for decentralized governance and inclusive development across Liberia. Supported by UN Women through the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, the workshop provided a critical platform for building the technical capacity of county-level administrations. UN Women played a leading role in the development of training materials focusing on gender concepts, mainstreaming, and analysis, as well as a comprehensive guidance document on gender action plan development. These resources ensured that gender-responsive approaches were integrated into county-level planning and implementation processes. A total of 28 participants attended the training in Bopolu, Gbarpolu County (6 females and 22 males), while 30 participants attended in Gbarnga, Bong County (12 females and 18 males). Female participation was higher in Bong (40%) compared to Gbarpolu (33%).The workshop delivered key outcomes, including the development of draft gender action plans, strengthened capacities in project management, and enhanced knowledge of gender-responsive budgeting and inclusive planning. These achievements empower the newly established DPUs to lead transformative and equitable development initiatives, with a particular focus on integrating gender considerations into local governance. Participants demonstrated strong commitment to applying their new skills to improve governance and engage communities, despite challenges such as logistical constraints and high staff turnover. To sustain these gains, recommendations include targeted recruitment to improve gender balance, sustained funding for capacity-building efforts, and structured follow-up to reinforce training outcomes. This collaborative initiative underscores Liberia‚Äôs commitment to building a decentralized governance framework that is inclusive, gender-responsive, and aligned with national development goals.WONGOSOL and her network members also began to engage with local government officials to advocate for better integration of GESI within the CDAs. Following the adoption of the CDAs, they will continue monitoring and advocacy in collaboration with CENTAL to establish clear accountability structures so that the plans do not just reference GESI but actively incorporate it in implementation. MIA and CENTAL and WONGOSOL will work closely with civil society and local government to support the implementation of these recommendations and monitor progress towards more inclusive and gender-sensitive local governance.",160092.0,130481.77,95072.55,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Through the partnership, 1,631 farmers (874 M, 757 F, 708 refugees and 923 HC) accessed an improved sesame seed variety (E107) and other inputs to plant a new high-yielding crop variety.Supported farmers to increase production of sesame: As a result of this intervention, refugee and HC farmers increased production, selling 345 tons of sesame worth US$420,000 in one season.Increased refugee access to finance services: Through a collaboration between ILO and Equity Bank, refugees have gained increased access to financial services. This enabled refugees who are disconnected from their homes to mitigate the immediate financial shocks of displacement. This has been achieved through the profiling of refugee farmers that is supported to provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information. This is important for them to access financial services. Using this KYC information, the Equity Bank has opened bank accounts for 890 refugee and HC farmers (562 M, 328 F, 356 refugees and 534 HC). Of these, 223 have accessed production loans from Equity Bank.

Each of these institutions is now offering tailored BDS through SIYB, GET Ahead, Integrated UPSHIFT and Promoting Social Cohesion and Peaceful Coexistence in Fragile Contexts through TVET The tailored BDS are being offered to refugees and HC under different interventions. For example, BDSPN is training trainers under the ILO Partnership with Ag-Ploutos, while FSME and UWEAL, both member-based organizations and operational in Rhino and Nakivale refugee settlements, are offering entrepreneurship support to their members. In the same vein, S4CU and Unleashed are also offering tailored services to refugees and HC through their incubation and learning centres in Nakivale settlement.  ",11836749.0,9134136.73,7310477.08,"WFP: To enhance youth and women engagement in agriculture WFP trained a total of 15,908 youth and 18,008 women in PHM, market access, equipment manufacture, and financial literacy to create sustainable jobs in the agriculture sector. As a result, WFP created a total of 6,229 (2,254 males and 4,014 females) jobs in the areas of operation. WFP conducted gender and youth consultations to understand how gender influences participation in agricultural activities. The highest concentration of women and youth was in agricultural production and least was in value addition and input provision. This will inform future implementation modalities to support women and youth to diversify into other enterprises.Market Access:  WFP enhanced smallholder farmers‚Äô access to diversified markets through the assisted farmer groups and organizations. In addition to WFP direct purchases, smallholder farmers accessed markets through local food procurement modalities, private sector buyers (traders, millers, processors and village collectors), and schools. Agricultural Market Support teams, together with supply chain, supported ten farmer groups from Karamoja to bulk and sell 2,345 MT of food commodities worth USD 1,916,696 to WFP. This food was supplied to schools to feed 216,301 learners in 315 schools who are beneficiaries under the HGSF programme. Overall, there was a fivefold increase in the value and volume of locally procured food from Karamoja compared to 2022. WFP developed strategic procurement modalities under the Local and Regional Food Procurement Policy, engaging commercial traders and suppliers through Pro Small-Holder Farmer (SHF) contracts. In 2023, WFP injected USD 44 million into the Ugandan economy through 75,000 MT of local food purchases; out of which USD 28 million (58,000 MT) was through pro-SHF modalities. A total of 11,866 farmers (76 percent female and 24 percent male) were trained on market access modules (business planning, record keeping, collective bulking, marketing, governance, and business centre management) to empower them with marketing skills. To strengthen the structure and functions of farmer groups, WFP trained 3,235 leaders (55 percent females and 45 percent males - 25 percent refugees) from Farmer Organizations (Fos) and Farmer Groups (FGs) on business centre management.UNDPUNDP strengthened the production capacity of refugees and host communities engaged in Cassava and Sesame Value Chains resulting in improved food security and increased household incomes.

Digital lending to smallholder farmers leveraging alternative credit scoring algorithms - based on data from farmer cooperatives / producer organizations, 28 cooperatives were digitized on the platform.  Lessons learnt:  Most of the SMEs require extensive capacity building / business development services to qualify for funding. This often delays the SMEs accessing the much-needed funding.   The farmers need integrated solutions combining agricultural support services and financial services. Financial and digital literacy are foundational to the uptake and usage of digitally enabled financial services.   Challenges:  Very few SMEs have all the requirements for financing such as collateral and proper records.  Pricing (affordability) of digital and financial services remains a key barrier to access and usage especially for low income vulnerable communities  Due to climate change that affects the yields of the crops, most of the framers are defaulting I.e. loan repayments are delayed. UNCDFFrom $ 221k , $ 88,933 loan received by small and medium enterprises of forcibly displaced urban refugees. From 246 beneficiaries, 27% are urban refugees and 73% hosts, 23% males and 73% females . This has led to increase access to financing to urban refugees and host communities in Arua and Gulu Cities.WFP:WFP with funding from the Master Card Foundation is implementing a programme targeting small holder farmers particularly women and youth with the goal of increasing job opportunities for women and youth along various agricultural value chains. During the reporting year, the programme held consultations with youth and women to understand how gender influences participation in Agricultural activities. The consultations noted the highest concentration of women and youth at the production node and least at the value addition and input provision nodes of the value chain. The consultations identified gender division of labor based on stereotypes that hinders women and youth from achieving their full potential. This will be tackled through gender transformative approaches to influence positive norms and a supportive environment at household and community levels. The consultations established that there is potential for expanding employment opportunities for women and youth at the production as wage-based gardeners using small, mechanized traction and shelling equipment. Male youth can be supported as local assemblers or aggregators and female youth as sorters and graders. Off-farm opportunities include; storekeepers and local cashier jobs at collection centers establishing mills and sales outlet jobs: such as machine operators, loaders and packaging and salespersons. Educated youth can be trained and certified to manage usage, storage, handling  maintenance of agro-inputs  farm implements and act as agents in supplying agro-inputs  farm implements. These findings will be used to design tailored interventions for the Master Card Foundation Programme.FAOFAO successfully established and nurtured the passion fruit value chain in Kiryandongo, benefitting a total of 3,165 participants (comprising 1,798 refugees and 1,367 host community members). Each household received essential resources, including 20 passion fruit seedlings, watering cans, and hoes. As a result, not only did productivity witness a significant boost, but the participants also experienced a notable increase in their income.FAO established 30 Cassava multiplication gardens (a total of 44 hectares) in Kaberamaido and Katakwi with a focus on developing and promoting the Cassava value chain. This initiative aimed to benefit a total of 8,000 beneficiaries, including 3,000 in Kaberamaido and 5,000 in Katakwi. The primary goal of this effort is to enhance food security and income in Kaberamaido and Katakwi Districts in Teso sub-region. Under the Dutch project, a total of 104 acres of cassava multiplication gardens were established; 24 acres in Luwero, 30 acres in Nakaseke, 50 acres in Nakasongola aimed at benefiting a total of 25 multiplier beneficiaries (7 in Luwero, 8 in Nakaseke, and 10 in Nakasongola) who will in-turn provide clean planting materials to individuals in their respective communities.FAO is launching the Green Gram, Simsim, and groundnut value chain initiatives in Kaberamaido and Katakwi, with a target of benefiting 8,000 participants (3,000 in Kaberamaido and 5,000 in Katakwi). This endeavor aims to enhance the income of the participants significantly. Poultry- chicken, sheep, goats targeting 8000. Cash and Voucher modality will be employed in the distribution of the inputs.FAO is launching the poultry (chicken specifically) and small livestock including goats, and sheep value chain initiatives in Kaberamaido and Katakwi, with a target of benefiting 8,000 participants (3,000 in Kaberamaido and 5,000 in Katakwi). This endeavor aims to improve nutrition and enhance the income of the participants significantly.Farmers have received training in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), including sustainable agricultural systems, benefiting a total of 9,077 individuals. Specifically, 5,912 beneficiaries in Nakivale and 3,165 in Kiryandongo have undergone this training. Furthermore, multiple training sessions are scheduled for Farmer Field School (FFS) groups in Karamoja (comprising 368 FFS groups with a total of 10,957 members), Teso (consisting of 252 FFS groups with a total of 8,000 members), and Kiryandongo (featuring 132 FFS groups with 3,165 members), with each FFS group comprising 25-30 members. Following these training sessions, participants will also receive high-quality agricultural inputs to support their practices.These comprehensive interventions were thoughtfully designed to empower beneficiaries not only through the provision of essential resources but also through a holistic approach to capacity building. Participants received training in critical areas such as good agricultural practices, equipping them with the knowledge to enhance crop yields sustainably. Additionally, they gained skills in effective record-keeping, which is essential for tracking progress and making informed decisions. Moreover, the program includes training in business skills, marketing and financial literacy, enabling participants to manage their agricultural ventures more efficiently and plan for long-term economic growth. This multifaceted support aims to foster self-reliance and improve the livelihoods of the targeted beneficiaries.UN Women6,859 women farmers gained knowledge and skills through training, mentorship and ongoing monitoring and are practicing climate smart agriculture. These include 4,500 women growing climate resistant fruits in Nwoya district, 1,400 women engaged in aquaculture in Bugiri district and 959 refugee women with skills in climate smart agricultural (CSA) practices including timely planting, proper spacing, soil and water conservation practice and crop pests and diseases management.

This is in addition to targeted actions for promoting an integrated landscape management approach for the conservation of the Mount Elgon ecosystem in Eastern Uganda",8423756.0,7143159.72,6333900.73,"The UN supported the sustainable management of natural resources With support from the United Nations (UN) and partners, capacity was strengthened to deploy nature-based solutions. The capacity of Uganda‚Äôs central and local governments, civil society, communities, and private sector was strengthened to deploy Nature Based Solutions (NBS), and climate smart technologies to enhance inclusive green, and sustainable resilient development.   Through this support, the Government of Uganda restored over 38,941 ha of degraded wetland 6,655 ha of degraded associated catchments, 1,075 hectares of forests, and increased provision of alternative livelihood options from 1,176 (642 males, 534 females) in 2021 to 3,814 people (2,348 males 1,466 females) in 2022 whose livelihood depend on unsustainable use of wetland resources1. Overall, at the national level, the area covered by wetlands has increased from 8.9 percent in 2015 to 9.4% and forest coverage also increased from 12.4 to 13% in 2022. This support also improved the adaptative capacity of 30% of the entire population in and around the wetlands through strengthening access to reliable weather and climate information and scaling up advisories for farmers and other targeted communities. Early warning systems were also regularly maintained to improve response time to anticipated disasters, season planning as well as inform the aviation industry. Nature Based solutions through restoration of wetlands and agro-based landscapes is one of the most cost effective and sustainable approaches to building climate resilient communities and landscapes. Tree growing as part of this action also benefited environmental programming into government systems. In addition, support was provided on catchment conservation activities including afforestation, gully controls and fish farming as a way of strengthening assets creation and livelihoods.  In a continuing effort to enhance the capacity of District Local Governments and communities to sustainably manage degraded lands, 60 community based micro-watershed management plans were developed in the cattle corridor regions and west Nile. As a result, 2,408 hectares of additional area of natural resources were brought under sustainable management. This included re-planting of degraded rangelands with drought tolerant pastures and fodder crops; construction of 213,900 meters of soil erosion structures thus, retention ditches, stone bunds among others; supporting communities and households to scale up bio-energy plantations and woodlots2. Support for the establishment of communal and private tree nurseries continued to be a major success driver in efforts to increase access to improved tree species and technologies for expanding the adoption sustainable natural resources management practices. Additionally, sustainable water management systems were expanded: 95 small-scale water management systems (including water harvesting systems) were established along with the rehabilitation of valley tanks to support crop and livestock production. This included the establishment of small-scale solar-powered irrigation systems in 9 districts, rehabilitation of existing small-scale irrigation schemes, and construction of rainwater harvesting tanks/valley tanks in districts of Sembabule and Isingiro. Hydrogeological and geophysical surveying for ground water and borehole drilling was completed in the cattle corridor, Karamoja and West Nile. As part of the refugee hosting communities support, a total of 7,669,414 assorted seedlings were produced as part of the engagements with refugee hosting communities and resulted into the restoration of 250 hectares of degraded forest reserves in the refugee hosting districts of Yumbe, Kikuube, and Kyegegwa3. To sustain the gains made in wetland recovery, a total of 3,814 (2,348 males 1,466 females) wetland dependent community beneficiaries were supported with alternative livelihoods including piggery, improved goats, apiculture, poultry and vegetable seeds for gardens adjacent to the wetlands. These interventions have enhanced their incomes allowing them to advance from subsistence agricultural enterprises to commercial enterprises, biodiversity conservation and overall natural resource management. This will help in preventing the wetland dependent community people from returning to further degrade the wetlands.   Strengthened partnerships with the government of Uganda on Nature Based Solutions (NBS)  Collaboration was enhanced with government agencies, both central and local, NGOs, UN agencies, research institutions and local academic institutions to obtain refugee-related information. This information and institutional recommendations were used for preventive and mitigation measures. The alignment of the UN Refugee afforestation initiatives with Uganda‚Äôs NDP III introduced a different approach to long-term development planning, by adopting a programme rather than sector-based approach. This approach was better able to leverage the benefits of different sectors and players. The program approach also fits in perfectly with the UN‚Äôs Results Based Management Approach which was better able to utilize scarce resources.  Additionally, support to Government on climate impact forecasting enabled the development of triggers and thresholds to drought in Karamoja to inform early action and early response. New partnerships with the Ugandan entrepreneurial eco-system were established in 2022. These partnerships included an entrepreneur support organization and seven small and growing businesses in Uganda working towards strengthening resilient and climate-smart food systems.  Strengthened human and institutional capacity. The UN developed and updated the Migration Environment and Climate Change (MECC) orientation and training module for Government counterparts and partners to deliver MECC nexus. The intervention strengthened key stakeholders' capacities in addressing the needs of environmental migrants or displaced persons and identification of viable community-based adaptation measures. About 6,139 (148 males, 5,991 females) people benefited from skills building and orientation trainings on a series of thematic areas. These included Migration Environment and Climate Change (MECC) Nexus, fruit tree planting, livelihoods and social and environmental safeguards, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices, monitoring reporting and verification (MRV) of the implementation of climate actions, crime scene management among others at national and sub national levels.  Specifically, in Adjumani, 455 acres of land were planted with guava seedlings and green grams (200 acres land for refugee women farmers and 255 acres for host women farmers). The 1,000 women farmers trained on CSA were enabled to increase their acreage under cultivation of drought resistant seedlings of guava, mangos and green gram seeds. A total of 45,000 guava seedlings, 5,000kg of green grams, 140 litres of herbicides (pin up) and 15 pieces of spray pumps (one pump per group for 15 groups) were delivered to women in Adjumani which enabled them to plant 455 acres; while 370 beneficiaries in Yumbe were supported with improved drought resistant seedlings of guava, and green gram seeds and were able to plant 370 acres.  The UN also supported the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) to undertake downscaling of seasonal forecasts to the district level and ensure effective dissemination of Climate Information as well as appropriate multi-sectoral advisories and radio talk shows. In addition, procurement, distribution, and operationalization of energy saving stoves at designated refugee reception centres and to a section of refugees with special needs.  Also, the UN integrated Climate Risk Management through its Agriculture Market Support interventions including provision of solar driers and low energy food processors. This is to help to reduce the pressure on forest as a source of biomass for cooking that reduces forest degradation.  All targeted communities reported receiving weather updates and 71 percent scored highly on climate capacity, with only 29 percent receiving a medium score. However, the proportion of communities with evidence of capacity to manage climate shocks and risks declined from 86 percent in 2021 to 57 percent in 2022. This was partly attributed to four factors: increased intensity of climate shocks such as drought, the indirect effects of preventive measures to minimize COVID-19 spread, the burden of malnutrition, and the increase of insecurity and its associated protection risks. Environmental safeguards and support to environmental management were promoted as part of the UN work to avoid unintended environmental harm. Environmental and social safeguards screening on all asset creation and livelihood initiatives in both the Karamoja and Southwest sub-regions in 2022 were undertaken. In line with the safeguards, fishponds constructed in swampy areas in Karamoja were designed with water outlets for excess water to flow into surrounding crop fields. The design reduced disruptions to community water source access which is relied on for agricultural production and also moderated water flow and controlled water and soil loss. UN strengthened the capacity of partner institutions including representatives from Ministries Departments and Agencies, cities, municipalities, districts, Civil Society Organizations, and the private sector on Social and Environmental Screening (SES). The training was also extended to over 60 participants from different partner agencies. A training manual on social and environmental safeguards was developed for dissemination and utilization by different stakeholders. This training in addition to enhancing the capacity of implementing programmes and partner staff is also strengthening quality programming by ensuring a principled approach, maximizing SES opportunities and benefits, and strengthening the capacity for managing social and environmental risks. The training is also ensuring stakeholder engagement including through a mechanism to respond from project affected people and minimize, mitigate, and manage adverse impacts where avoidance is not possible. Under the Child-Sensitive Social Protection programme, the UN supported through the Office of the Prime Minister the enhancement of the capacity of 31 environmental and social safeguards committees across eight programme districts in West Nile to identify, manage and refer safeguards issues arising from the implementation of the NutriCash component of the UN  programmes.  The UN reached 14,663 beneficiaries through cash and asset transfers, improving nutritious food access and capacity to cope with shocks. The beneficiaries were pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of two years with nutrition-sensitive cash transfers. The cash was complemented with training on financial literacy and backyard gardening as well as social and behavior change communication. Preliminary NutriCash results showed that 48 percent of beneficiaries had acceptable food consumption scores. The UN also ensured that environmental assessments were conducted and opportunities for environmental improvements were identified, for energy efficiency, renewables and waste management interventions and enhanced their mainstreaming in the routine implementation of activities. The UN and partners supported a mapping study of natural resources and the main agrarian systems in 13 districts of Abim, Amolatar, Amudat, Amuria, Buyende, Kaberamaido, Kamuli, Katakwi, Kayunga, Luwero, Nakasongola, Nakaseke and Napak. This is used to inform the development of climate adaptation actions in the target districts. ",5687072.0,4682101.76,3252648.25,"UNDP provided technical assistance in waste flow surveys and characterization of waste and determination of energy generation potentials for the cities of Masaka, Mbale, Mbarara and Jinja ‚Äì producing data such as per capita waste generation and average waste generation, mapping of collection solid waste sites, waste collection efficiency, percentage of sorted waste and organic waste will be obtained to assess energy quantity through calorific value, moisture content and biomethane potential tests in order to identify the most suitable technology, as well as the highest energy capacity.UNDP supported capacity development to enhance effective participation in UNFCCC climate change negotiations and development of Uganda‚Äôs position paper for COP28.In collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Environment Climate Change Department and with joint support from the German Development Cooperation (GIZ, UNFCCC Regional Collaboration Centre and the Italian Embassy, the capacity for the youth to participate in climate change negotiations has been enhanced. A training workshop for the youth on climate change negotiations was conducted. The training was attended by 130 youth including 50 female and 80 male from both the national level and the district local governments.UNHCR in collaboration with the National Forestry Authority replanted and maintained a total of 200 hectares of degraded central forest reserves thus, 100 hectares in Lodonga Central Forest Reserve in Yumbe and 100 hectares in Lokiragodo Central Forest Reserve in Arua. NFA also maintained 673ha of replanted forest reserves through spot, strip and slash weeding to ensure the planted seedlings survive to restore the ecosystems to their natural state.Aditionally, 677 hectares of woodlots have been established to replenish the tree cover in refugee-hosting landscapes and set up woodlots for energy.761 hectares of woodlots established from 2021 to date were maintained using the agroforestry modality where refugee groups were allowed to plant short rotation crops among the tree rows so that while they tend to their crops, they are also tending to the trees creating a mutually beneficial partnership between nationals and refugees.UNHCR committed to support bricket production and establish improved cookstove production and distribution. A total of 29,658 energy-saving cookstoves were disseminated at the household level by the end of September of which 60.1% (17,824 stoves) in South Sudan situation, 21.2% (6,276 stoves) among Congolese households, 18.7% (5,558 stoves) among the host community and the rest (60 stoves) among urban refugees. In addition, 15 tons of briquettes supplied to 150 households among urban refugees (100kg per household) accompanied with an improved cook stove and a cooking basket as one package. FAO supported the revision of the Bidibidi Forest management plan intended to provide recommended actions to implement interventions for the (i) establishment of energy woodlots in and around Bidibidi settlement; (ii) rehabilitation of degraded forest and other land; and (iii) protection of natural forests. FAO facilitated 13 districts to understand and contextualize natural resources, agrarian systems and land uses by fully describing transformation dynamics in a climate change context.

With support from the UN, a costed Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) implementation and resource mobilization plan was developed by the Ministry of Water and Environment and utilized to guide development of the NDC implementation and resource mobilization and 5 concept notes. The concepts were developed to support resource mobilization for NDC implementation in areas including; improving rangeland and mountain ecosystem-based adaptation; climate change governance; post-harvest handling and management; strengthening climate resilient infrastructure, forestry and energy efficiency. In addition, the framework and guidelines for carbon market mechanisms were developed and the capacity of Uganda national task force on carbon markets was built with respect to the provisions and implications of Article 6 (6.2 and 6.4) of the Paris Agreement which focuses on carbon markets development. Uganda's involvement in the international carbon market is expected to unlock the opportunities to attract the private sector to invest in climate mitigation programmes and exchange the potential mitigation outcomes through bilateral cooperation with participating countries.  Through the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL)-Uganda Mechanism and its Performance-Based Climate Resilience Grants (‚ÄúPBCRGs‚Äù), a climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) report for subnational adaptation was developed providing data for climate risk-informed local planning. The report identified and mapped climate risk, exposure and vulnerability hotspots at the district level in Uganda.  The Government of Uganda integrated migration, environment and climate change (MECC) nexus into the environment sector development and district development plan.    National and sub-national government capacity for emergency preparedness and response was enhanced by strengthening shock-responsive systems in Karamoja. The programme implemented seven out of eight planned systems-strengthening interventions and continued to fast-track the scale-up of anticipatory action for food security across the Karamoja sub-region. Enhancements were vital to improving emergency preparedness capacity from an emergency preparedness capacity index value of 2 in 2021 to 2.79. Thresholds and triggers to enable anticipatory action for drought and floods were established. In addition, UNMA‚Äôs capacity was strengthened through engagement with Intergovernmental Authority on Development Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC). UNMA‚Äôs institutional, technical, skills gaps and infrastructural capabilities were established, and capacity was built for impact-based forecasting.  ÔªøUNCDF has supported the Government of Uganda (GoU), with financial support from the Government of Belgium, to implement the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL)-Uganda Mechanism and its Performance-Based Climate Resilience Grants (‚ÄúPBCRGs‚Äù) as a window of the Discretional Development Grants (DDD). LoCAL-Uganda aims to provide supplementary capital to finance local public climate change resilient investments in target districts and to increase awareness and capacities to respond to climate change at the local level, integrate climate change adaptation into local governments' planning and budgeting systems, in a participatory and gender-responsive manner, and increase level of climate finance available to local government authorities (i.e. Districts) for climate-smart, resilient investments. LoCAL-Uganda aims to support Districts across the country to localize and align their planning to the National Climate Change Policy, Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plan process.  The LoCAL-Uganda was officially launched during a high-level event organized in Kampala, on 25 May 2022, with the presence of ministers, development partners and pilot districts, which marked the official kick off of the activities for the deployment of LoCAL. This was followed by the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the deployment of the LoCAL mechanism and transfer of the PBCRGs to target districts in July 2022. The MoU was signed between UNCDF and the GoU, represented by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), which will provide financial management and monitoring of funds delivered under LoCAL-Uganda.  A climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) report for subnational adaptation was developed and further validated by GoU in September 2022, in particular by MoWE. The CRVA report aims to provide data for climate risk-informed local planning by identifying and mapping climate risk, exposure and vulnerability hotspots at the district level in Uganda. With such information local decision makers, in consultation with their communities, will be able to prioritize climate change adaptation actions and investments based on quantified scientific analysis. (Paraphrase with the result coming first)  Applying a screening sheet based on criteria such as LG performance assessment (LGPA) results, climate risk and vulnerability data, poverty and population size, four districts have emerged as top ones in the screening process: Kasese, Zombo, Nebbi and Nwoya. The selection of the four districts have been validated by GoU and they form the pool of target districts receiving supporting in Phase 1 of LoCAL-Uganda. Additional districts will be identified in the next phase of LoCAL as PBCRGs are scaled up to additional districts.

The youth expo was an ingenious initiative designed to foster innovation and unearth youth-led creative ideas and development solutions to address the defining crises of the 21st century. The expo was under the Organized under the theme, ‚ÄúFostering Innovations for Uganda‚Äôs Transformational Development‚Äù. As part of the youth and innovation expo, a dialogue on youth and climate action was organised to discuss opportunities for youth engagement in climate action. The event was organised in collaboration with the UNFCCC Regional Collaboration centre for East and Southern Africa and was attended by 120 youth. It enhanced the understanding of the youth about the different opportunities on climate action, showcased interventions and innovations undertaken by youth in key sectors such as renewable energy, climate smart agriculture, waste management among others.UNDP supported capacity development on reporting, tracking and data collection on climate action.UNDP has provided support to develop an integrated Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) tool which is online, and web based to enhance government‚Äôs reporting, tracking and data collection on climate action and NDC targets. The MRV tool has five components which include the Greenhouse gas inventory, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, climate finance flows and SDG impacts. The reporting will be made on all the five components of the tool. In addition to the development of the tool, capacity development has been conducted for the Agriculture, Forestry and Land use (AFOLU) sector to build the technical capacity of representatives from Ministries, Departments and Agencies, representatives from District local governments, Civil Society organizations and the private sector to use the tool and enhance reporting on climate action at both national and international level. Capacity development for other sectors is being planned. UNCDFThe partnership between UNCDF, the MoLG, MoFPED and the MoWE, under the operational grant agreements, deployed in situ capacity-building activities. These include sensitization, training and capacity building at the district level, as well as sensitization activities with beneficiary communities to increase their understanding of climate risks, the functioning of the LoCAL mechanism and the LoCAL investment menu. This effort is complemented by direct technical support and quality assurance from UNCDF. During the period covered by this report, project implementation teams were selected in the target districts of Kasese, Nwoya, Zombo and Nebbi; these are engaged in climate risk assessments and the selection of climate investments. Following various missions to the field, guidelines for the use of the Performance-Based Climate Resilience Grant (PBCRG) and a local government performance assessment manual were finalized with support from UNCDF in partnership with the Overseas Development Institute‚Äôs (ODI‚Äôs) Uganda office. These guidelines and manual constitute the framework for implementation of the PBCRG in Uganda districts under the LoCAL mechanism and provide a methodology to implement local adaptive interventions through local governments‚Äô planning and budgeting systems.Through inception meetings and trainings held to guide districts in LoCAL implementation, the pilot districts of Kasese, Nwoya, Zombo and Nebbi were prepared to go through a baseline assessment; this took place in November‚Äì December 2022. Trainings were also held to support local governments in mainstreaming LoCAL interventions into their district annual plans and budgets for FY 2023/2024 using LoCAL PBCRGs and the ACCAF tool. Specifically, local governments were trained to use the ACCAF tool in planning, monitoring and reporting. This training led to the formation and orientation of the LoCAL National Resource Pool, composed of representatives from the MoLG, the MoWE, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), the MoFPED, UNCDF and the ODI Budget Strengthening Initiative. The National Resource Pool is responsible for supporting districts during LoCAL implementation. Trainings were held at the district level to inform and introduce participants to the LoCAL mechanism‚Äîincluding the PBCRG, budgeting and implementation guidelines; the LoCAL performance assessment manual; and the ACCAF Tracker, among others‚Äîconcluded successfully.From 21 September to 6 October 2023, the MoFPED and its Climate Finance Unit were partly supported by UNCDF to participate and conduct regional budget conferences. Representatives from Uganda‚Äôs 135 districts were in attendance across Northern, Central, Eastern and Western Uganda. The regional budget conferences were leveraged to build local government authorities‚Äô capacity for climate change integration in district budgets.WFPUnder PRO-ACT, WFP supported a concerted effort to strengthen the shock-responsiveness of national social protection systems, including through the scale up of Anticipatory Action. The importance of this work was underscored by the anticipated El Ni√±o floods and worsening droughts in Karamoja. As a result of WFP's emergency preparednessand response capacity strengthening efforts for central and district local governments under PRO-ACT, the Emergency Preparedness Capacity Index Score remained stable between 2022 and 2023 at 2.7 against a target of 3.0 compared to 1.44 at the baseline in 2019.To enhance national and sub-national capacities to respond to shocks, WFP in collaboration with the government, embarked on strengthening the shock-responsiveness of the national social protection system. This ongoing work, which will be completed in the first half of 2024, include a feasibility study for the proposed National Social Registry, development of national shock responsive social protection guidelines, and an assessment of the shock responsiveness of the Social Assistance Grant for Empowerment programme.WFP provided technical assistance to the Office of the Prime Minister to produce the Annual State of Disaster Report for 2022/2023. This report offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of disasters, providing valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making and resource allocation for future preparedness and response.As part of its efforts to scale up Anticipatory Action in Uganda, WFP supported the co-development of comprehensive Anticipatory Action Plans (AAP) for drought and floods for the Karamoja sub-region, providing a structured guide for Government-led initiatives in anticipating and mitigating disasters based on precise weather forecasts.In collaboration with Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), WFP co-developed forecast triggers and thresholds for floods, contributing to increasing precision in disaster response in affected locations. Through the agreement on indicators and the enhancement of UNMA's capacity in flood forecasting, the initiative has elevated the accuracy and timeliness of early warnings, ensuring a more effective and targeted approach in disaster mitigation.WFP supported UNMA to generate downscaled 2023 seasonal climate forecasts. Through sub-national forums, the initiative ensured the creation of national and regional downscaled forecasts with sector-specific advisories. This proactive approach not only enhanced the accuracy of climate predictions but also facilitated the dissemination ofcritical information in terms of advisories to disaster-prone areas, empowering communities, and relevant sectors to make informed decisions in the face of imminent climatic challenges.A significant milestone was achieved on extension of climate services through the dissemination of early warning information to last-mile communities. Leveraging channels such as schools, community radios, and outreach sites, monthly bulletins and actionable advisories derived from seasonal forecasts were effectively disseminated in partnership with FAO. A total of 616,000 people were reached (69 percent of the total population). This initiative not only empowered communities to take anticipatory actions in advance of potential drought and floods, but also laid the foundation for a proactive response by WFP and Government during the 2023 Lean Season, fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience.To mitigate the impacts of climate change, WFP continues to support the Government to scale-up of anticipatory actions in Uganda, this included supporting DLGs in Karamoja to disseminate early warning advisories to 616,000 people, which enabled them to make informed decisions to safeguard their crops, livestock, and other assets. In collaboration with the National Agriculture Research Organisation, WFP also promoted the utilization of drought-tolerant crop varieties that can survive in harsh dry season conditions that prevail in Karamoja sub-region. WFP also embarked on capacity strengthening to skill stakeholders on Environmental and Social Risk Screening. In compliance with WFP‚Äôs Environmental Policy and its Sustainability Framework, WFP ensured that activities under the CSP do not cause unintended harm to the environment and people. In 2023, 100 percent of the implemented activities under ACL and AMS were subjected to an environmental and social risk screening and mitigation measures were put in placeUN Women‚Ä¢ Strengthened Capacity of 500 women and 200 men to access emergency social protection and climate friendly livelihoods opportunities (250 Southwest, 250 Karamoja), 200 men (100 S.W and 100 Karamoja) youth and GBV survivors to mitigate the impact of drought and displacement. ‚Ä¢1,057 beneficiaries from 48 producer groups comprising of (959 women and girls ,134 men) were trained in different Climate smart Agricultural practices including timely planting, proper spacing, soil and water conservation practice and crop pests and diseases management. ‚Ä¢Facilitated 48 self-help producer groups with 2,235 kgs of sunflower, maize, beans, sesame, and soya beans that were planted on 207 acres of land. ‚Ä¢ 608 (493 Female, 110 Male and 5 Girls) farmers were trained in soil management, ",5224423.0,4689936.8,3170446.11,,5224423.0,4220087.26,3268711.86,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

In 2022, the UN supported the setting up of Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL)-Uganda which has set up necessary conditions and frameworks that will enable an efficient roll-out of the LoCAL approach. The LoCAL mechanism in Uganda is a national mechanism for financing local climate adaptation enabling districts and their communities to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Uganda‚Äôs NDCs, NAP process and SDG 13 in the context of national development priorities, NDP III and NPDM. This is fundamental in the implementation of cross-sectoral investments for climate adaptation. The LoCAL mechanism will enhance resource mobilization from adaptation and Green Climate fund. Furthermore, the UN also designed the Performance Based Climate Resilient Grants (PBCRG), Budget, Implementation and Reporting Guidelines as well as the LoCAL Annual Performance Assessment Manual. These are operating within the framework of the existing Government of Uganda‚Äôs Local Government Management of Service Delivery Performance Assessment with focus on climate change specific indicators.  The UN also signed several agreements with Ministries, including an MoU with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), letters of agreement (LoAs) with the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) and the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE), which support the implementation and monitoring of the LoCAL activities. In addition, Uganda‚Äôs Minister of State for Water, together with other 16 counterpart ministers, wete supported to launch a Ministerial Declaration, on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly at the New York Climate Week, calling for recognition of the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility as an existing Non-Market Approach under the Paris Agreement. The UN also supported the amendment of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets (PPDA) Act 2003 capping a reservation of 30% public procurement for women and other marginalized groups. Its implementation provides a better enabling environment for women in the private sector to benefit from public procurement. This was as a result of sustained advocacy with Government of Uganda by UN and its partners. PPDA as an institution now has a more gender responsive procurement system. It‚Äôs procurement requirement includes 30% reservation of all procurement for marginalized groups including women and PWDs in Government tenders. UN also supported PPDA through financing the pursuit of the PPDA amendment Act and facilitating awareness sessions to publicize its existence.  Additionally, four partners including the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD) and Uganda Police Force (UPF) were financially supported by UN to integrate gender equality into fiscal laws/policies/standards. UN in partnership with Makerere University also supported the development of evidence-based research and data to strengthen the understanding of the migration, environment and climate change (MECC) nexus among climate change and environment practitioners in Uganda. Key research findings shared with Governments and partners include; The need to document and create an understanding of the migration, environment and climate change nexus in Uganda, including the link between climate change and disaster risk reduction/management. Highlighted the need to support the Ministry of Water and Environment‚Äôs Climate Change Department to develop pending policies, including the Framework Strategy on Climate Change, the National Climate Change Action Plan, and the Climate Change Regulations to reflect and integrate the significance of environment and climate change on migration/human mobility. Provided evidence-based data that will provide the Ministry of Water and Environment, the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, and IOM with a benchmark to conduct credible and reliable research and further data and analysis on the link between environment and climate change and migration/human mobility.  Strengthened the partnership between the Ministry of Water and Environment‚Äôs Climate Change Department, the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, the Office of the Prime Minister, and IOM. It highlighted the need to develop actions, strategies, and measures to effectively meet the specific needs of people on the move, especially vulnerable groups, like women, girls, and children. It also emphasized the importance of building the resilience of affected persons and both sending and receiving communities that are impacted by environment and climate change.The Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL) mechanism in Uganda is a national mechanism for financing local climate adaptation enabling Districts and their communities to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Uganda‚Äôs NDCs, NAP process and SDG 13 in the context of national development priorities, NDP III and NPDM. In 2022, LoCAL-Uganda has set up necessary conditions and frameworks that will enable an efficient roll-out of the LoCAL approach. This included, for instance, defining and agreeing on the governance structure for the mechanism and aligning LoCAL and its PBCRG system with the existing local government grant structure as part of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Reforms, in particular as a window of the Discretional Development Grants (DDG). This will enable the implementation of cross-sectoral investments with climate adaptation additionality and to trace the funds, which is a requirement for accessing (international) climate finance and UNFCCC‚Äôs financial mechanisms, i.e. Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund. In addition, UNCDF also designed the PBCRG Grant, Budget, Implementation and Reporting Guidelines as well as the LoCAL Annual Performance Assessment Manual, which will be conducted within the framework of the existing Government of Uganda‚Äôs Local Government Management of Service Delivery Performance Assessment with focus on climate change specific indicators.  Moreover, UNCDF signed several agreements with the Ministries, including an MoU with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), letters of agreement (LoAs) with the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) and the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE), which support the implementation and monitoring of the LoCAL activities. In addition, Uganda‚Äôs Minister of State for Water, together with other 16 counterpart ministers, launched a Ministerial Declaration, on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly and New York Climate Week, in September 2022, calling for recognition of the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility as an existing Non-Market Approach under the Paris Agreement, as well as an effective vehicle to channel increased climate finance to the world‚Äôs most climate vulnerable nations and their communities, in support of locally led adaptation. These contribute to the strengthening of the enabling environment for expanding financing for climate adaptation targets in Uganda‚Äôs NDC.  ",1793824.0,1520667.31,1197895.74,"UNDP has developed Uganda‚Äôs carbon market framework which includes regulations, guidelines, and training manual to enhance participation in climate change mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and the Voluntary Carbon markets. The draft carbon market regulations, guidelines and training manual for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and the voluntary carbon markets have been developed. The regulations and guidelines outline national arrangements to mobilize carbon finance and support implementation of mitigation projects that contribute to the achievement of Uganda‚Äôs NDC target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 24.7% by 2030. The guidelines and regulations will enhance the Country‚Äôs participation in Article 6.2 cooperative approach and localising the procedures for developing projects under Article 6.4 Mechanisms and Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) toward achieving Uganda‚Äôs NDC targets. The guidelines provide guidance to Uganda‚Äôs strategy for engaging in Article 6.8 Non-Market Approaches and the Voluntary Carbon markets as a Participating Party. The training manual will enhance capacities to participate in these carbon market mechanisms.  UNCDF supported the establishment of the Performance Based Climate Resilience Grants (PBCRGs) system- The Government of Uganda has complied with the design related to releasing the UNCDF LoCAL PBCRGs. The PBCRG was aligned to the consolidated grant structure developed as part of Uganda‚Äôs intergovernmental fiscal transfer reforms.The PBCRG was presented as a subgrant under the discretionary development equalization grant (DDEG). This will enable the districts to implement cross-sectoral investments that have climate adaptation elements.The PBCRG was allocated and executed using Online Transfer Information Management System (OTIMS).The PBCRG is part of the final local government budgets. The PBCRG was uploaded by the MoFPED into the Integrated Financial Management System as part of the final local government budgets.The PBCRG is released as part of other development grants by the end of the third quarter and 50 per cent of the PBCRG was released together with other development grants in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023/2024.

With UN support, energy access in social institutions was enhanced. Support was provided to install solar photo voltaic systems in 24 health center IVs across the country. Solar PV installations were completed in 11 health centers and ongoing installations are being undertaken in 13 health centers. Each of these facilities serves a catchment area for over 30,000 people. This support is saving many lives especially for women and children. With the solar PV installation, safe delivery (including caesarean section) can be performed any time of the day, refrigerators for storing vaccines and blood, health centers now work 24/7, sickle cells clinic have been established. In addition, this has reduced the infant mortality rate due to the constant energy supply to baby incubators, and laboratory tests can be performed any time. The UN has also extended energy access to other social institutions which include 2 refuge settlements in Obongi and Adjumani districts, 7 immigration offices at border posts through installation of solar photo voltaic systems. This improved the livelihoods of communities in rural areas. A Renewable Energy Challenge Fund (RECF) was implemented with support from the Embassy of Sweden in Uganda. Since its inception, the RECF has supported 22 clean cooking and solar PV partners to sell 807,694 units and 8,246 tonnes of briquettes improving the lives of more than 4.3 million people with access to clean energy solutions. This has resulted into money savings, generation of income, reduced indoor air pollution, reduced burden on women from firewood collection and many hours spent on cooking instead of doing productive work. From January to June 2022, the RECF partners sold 23,179 solar and clean cooking products and 342 tonnes of briquettes. Furthermore, important lessons were learned linking energy with productive use. RECF also created a total of 566 full-time and part-time salaried jobs (with 49 created in 2022) and 2,676 commission-based agents and microentrepreneurs employed. On average, the percentage of full-time and part-time jobs created for females is 43% and youth employment is 44%. The commission-based agent jobs and microentrepreneurs have a percentage of females at 32% and higher percentage of youth at 84%.  Market Assessment on financial aggregation for small scale renewable assets was conducted to scale up financing and investment in small-scale renewable energy assets. The market assessment provided guidance to develop an Action Plan for promoting financial aggregation for scaling up investment in distributed renewable energy assets.   Waste management ordinances for cities have been developed to encourage waste-to-energy initiatives and integrated waste management. Waste flow characterization was supported in 4 cities to understand energy generation potentials of waste in the municipalities and a multi-stakeholder waste management platform established In collaboration with the East African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE,) UN strengthened the capacity of private sector actors in the energy efficiency sub-sector to develop energy service business models to attract financing for energy efficiency projects in the companies. Training on energy service business models to Energy Efficiency Association of Uganda (EEAU) member companies was conducted. The energy service business models include energy performance contracting, cooling as a service, lighting as a service, equipment leasing, etc. 20 participants from EEAU attended the training. The training was also used to promote the EELA Technical Assistance and Co-financing Facility where UN through the Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliances (EELA) Project in East and Southern Africa was providing 75% of project costs for energy efficiency projects that demonstrate the application of energy service business models. A similar training was conducted for energy efficiency stakeholders from other EAC and SADC Member States. East African Community (EAC) Regional Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for Lighting (Lamps and Luminaires) were developed and adopted by the EAC Standards Council and member countries including Uganda are now mandated to adopt them. The adopted standards include EAS 1064-1:2022, Lighting Products-Minimum Energy Performance Standard-Part 1-Lamps and EAS 1064-2:2022, Lighting Products-Minimum Energy Performance Standard-Part 2-Luminaires. The capacity of Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) to test the lighting products (lamps and luminaires) was built. UN equipped UNBS and the East African Centre of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Efficiency (EACREEE) with 2 portable lighting testing equipment. The equipment is used to test quality of imported lighting products and local manufactured lighting products to ensure that only energy efficient and high-quality lighting products are in Uganda‚Äôs market.  To reduce the pressure on natural forests due to increasing fuelwood demand, the UN expanded its afforestation programme through partnerships with communities to increase adoption of communal and private woodlots. In 2022, 45 hectares of bioenergy demonstration woodlots were established in central cattle corridor, West Nile  Karamoja and are providing a learning platform for farmers at the community level to gain skills and be acquainted with best practices in woodlot management.  UN supported the establishment of 144 flexi-biogas units in West-Nile, Central and Karamoja region and trained 230 local artisans in fabrication of energy saving stoves, who after training have fabricated and distributed 17,500 energy saving stoves in West Nile in refugee reception centres and to sections of refugees with special needs UN also supported the construction of a large-scale solar-powered water scheme to provide safe drinking water to 4,400 people, including for livestock and vegetable garden use.Ôªø UNCDF has been implementing the Renewable Energy Challenge Fund (RECF) supported by the Embassy of Sweden in Uganda. Since its inception, the RECF has supported 22 clean cooking and solar PV partners sold 807,694 units and 8,246 tonnes of briquettes improving the lives of more than 4.3 million people with access to clean energy solutions which save money, generate income, reduce indoor air pollution, lessen the burden on women from firewood collection and many hours spent on cooking instead of doing productive work.

On average, the percentage of full-time and part-time jobs created for females is 43% and youth employment is 44%. The commission-based agent jobs and microentrepreneurs have a percentage of females at 32% and higher percentage of youth at 84%.    From 2017 to financial year 2020/2021, RECF partners raised a total of USD $97.6 million (UGX 345 billion). Over 70% of the funds raised was debt finance, 28.4% was equity and other sources such as liabilities and interest received contributed 1.2%. RECF‚Äôs grant investment of USD $ 3,023,842 also unlocked an additional USD $5.64 million as cash and in-kind contribution from the RECF partners.   Through the programme on Integrated Local Finances for Sustainable Urban Development in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (PIFUD), UNCDF received concept notes from Mukono, Wakiso and Mpigi local governments to develop at least two solar mini-grids to be established in partnership with the host Local Governments and private sector within the GKMA. The mini-grids are expected to generate at least 100 KWp and connect at least 300 households and create local economic development impact in the locality. ",6729656.0,5210146.75,4193607.79,"FAO supported the establishment of 1000 hectares of wood energy plantations through field based training , training in nursery seedling production.UNDP supported procurement of three trommel machines for screening of organic compost to enhance throughput of aerobic composting plants. This will contribute to reduction of methane production from organic component of municipal solid wastes. UINDP also supported construction of 5 biogas-to-electricity demonstration plants in 5 cities (Jinja, Kampala, Masaka, Mbale and Mbarara).UNHCRUN Women Trained 100 women and youth  on agroforestry, fabrication, and use, making of fuel-efficient stovesA total of 29,658 energy-saving cookstoves were disseminated at the household level by the end of September of which 60.1% (17,824 stoves) in South Sudan situation, 21.2% (6,276 stoves) among Congolese households, 18.7% (5,558 stoves) among the host community and the rest (60 stoves) among urban refugees. In addition, 15 tons of briquettes were supplied to 150 households among urban refugees (100kg per household) accompanied with an improved cook stove and a cooking basket as one package.A total of 200 hectares of degraded central forest reserves were replanted and maintained in collaboration with the National Forestry Authority i.e. 100 hectares in Lodonga Central Forest Reserve in Yumbe and 100 hectares in Lokiragodo Central Forest Reserve in Arua. NFA also maintained 673ha of replanted forest reserves through spot, strip and slash weeding to ensure the planted seedlings survive to restore the ecosystems to their natural state.'- Also, 852 hectares of woodlots have been established to replenish the tree cover in refugee-hosting landscapes and set up woodlots for energy. Of these, 677ha were set up in the south sunda situation while the rest in the Congolese situation.'- 761 hectares of woodlots established from 2021 to date were maintained using the agroforestry modality where refugee groups were allowed to plant short rotation crops among the tree rows so that while they tend to their crops, they are also tending to the trees creating a mutually beneficial partnership between nationals and refugees.WFP Another notable initiative undertaken by WFP to address environmental concerns was the promotion of energy-efficient stoves in refugee hosting areas in Uganda. Traditional cooking methods, often reliant on biomass such as wood or charcoal, contribute to deforestation and emit harmful pollutants. WFP's distribution and promotion of energy-efficient stoves to 1,423 households not only reduced the demand for wood resources but also minimized air pollution. WFP also provided 36 large energy-efficient stoves to refugee reception centres. These stoves utilize less fuel, thereby decreasing the environmental impact and improving the overall health of communities. In 2023, WFP trained smallholder farmers, including women and youth, in making brickettes, which are an environmentally safer alternative to wood fuel. WFP complemented the efforts by supporting the participants to plant selected fruit trees to contribute to removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a way of climate change mitigation and prevention of soil erosion. WFP reached 18,665 beneficiaries (93 percent of plan) with capacity strengthening which included mainly trainings on different livelihood ventures and cash-based transfers amounting toUSD 775,018 of which USD 18,924 was disbursed to cash for assets beneficiaries. WFP also transferred assets worth USD 351,959 to improve household income generation and boost their capacity to cope with shocks and stressors in West Nile, Karamoja, and the Southwest. To promote access to cleaner cooking methods outside of firewood and tocontribute to environmental sustainability, WFP distributed fuel-efficient stoves and briquettes to 1,423 households in the Southwest and West Nile regions, achieving 100% of its planned target.In the refugee-hosting areas in the Southwest, WFP worked with refugee-led organizations to engage and motivate 1,220 refugee households to move from depending on food assistance and become self-reliant, through social behaviour change strategies, coaching, awareness raising and community engagement. To enhance diets, fish-farming was promoted through WFP‚Äôs incubation hubs, contributing to an increase of acceptable food consumption levels from 66 percent in 2022 to 76 percent in 2023 amongst benefiting households. WFP further partnered with Kikuube District Local Government through the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) to support efforts to extend water closer to production sites in rural refugee communities under the Government‚Äôs Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Programme (UGIFT).In Karamoja, WFP further supported households to diversify and adopt climate-resilient livelihoods, including beekeeping and fish-farming. A total of 949 beehives were distributed to 270 households, targeting Losidok, Kamion, Katikekile, Panyangara, Nakapelimoru communities in Karamoja. Beekeeping initiatives yielded multifaceted benefits to the livelihoods of host communities: enhanced hive/honey production, boosted environmental conservation via pollination, diversified income through honey sales, and empowered youth through employment. Simultaneously, the introduction of fish-farming led to a significant increase in diversification of diets in the targeted households in Karamoja, introducing a sustainable and nutritious protein source into the diets of Karamojong households.To enhance existing cross-border trade and access between Karamoja (Uganda) and Turkana (Kenya), WFP supported 522 households to construct a 21 km road across the border by participating in cash-for-work. As a result, local businesses on both sides of the border benefited from expanded markets, reduced transportation costs, and 83.5 percent of the target households reported that the rehabilitated road in their community improved the ability of their household members to access markets and basic services such as WASH and education.
