These engagements assessed the regulatory landscape, identified challenges, and proposed policy reforms for inclusive digital financial services. Key recommendations to regulators included strengthening data portability to empower consumers to have choice in dealing with financial service providers, enhancing consumer protection frameworks to build trust and confidence in digital financial services, fostering cybersecurity resilience to ensure financial sector integrity, and fostering innovation in tailored financial solutions for MSMEs and women entrepreneurs, such as micro-merchant profiling and credit facilities.

UNCDF‚Äôs technical assistance of the Ministry of Trade aims at ensuring that the new bill adequately provides for the needs and realities of underserved segments like micro enterprises from unfair market practices that impact consumers. To facilitate this, UNCDF organized a stakeholder consultation workshop to integrate diverse perspectives into the law development process. The Competition Bill is set to be presented to cabinet for approval, after which it will be tabled in Parliament before being assented to by the President.

This was commonly highlighted by students from rural areas attending coding training in community day services. This demonstrates their confidence in explaining and utilising the skills and knowledge gained from the project.Innovative digital solutions: 122 girls and young women who participated in 3 regional coding bootcamps utilized the knowledge and skills gained by developing different innovations. These innovations are expected to enable the developers earn income out of their innovations or unlock opportunities for their employment. For example, a who led the development of the smart greenhouse technology which has been adopted by Mzuzu University and Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources as a prototype has been given a masters scholarship that she is currently undertaking at the Mzuzu University.UNICEF Key Achievements: UNICEF made significant strides in supporting alternative learning pathways and delivering transferable skills to out-of-school adolescents. Through the Complementary Basic Education (CBE) program, 8,993 learners (4,179 girls) across 28 districts and 204 centers were provided foundational literacy and numeracy skills, enabling a streamlined transition to formal primary schools. Additionally, a nine-month functional literacy program established 178 centers in Dedza, Kasungu, Mangochi, and Salima districts, enrolling 12,630 adolescents (9,620 girls) and training 900 village literacy committee members to promote and manage informal learning. To further equip adolescents with essential skills, 2,342 young people (1,207 girls) received entrepreneurship training through the National Youth Council of Malawi. Capacity-building initiatives trained 360 adolescents as mental health champions and engaged others in climate action, fostering leadership and resilience. These programs not only expand learning opportunities but also empower adolescents to develop skills critical for their reintegration into education and the workforce, promoting sustainable development. In collaboration with the Malawi University of Science and Technology and with support from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, UNICEF facilitated awareness-building on climate change and its impacts, benefiting 559 youth (302 female) from underrepresented backgrounds in six flood-prone districts in the South and empowering 100 children and youth aged 12 to 24 (60 female) with entrepreneurial and innovation skills to create climate solutions for their communities.Challenges: Low retention rates in educational programs amongst adolescents.Opportunities and Priorities: Expand mentorship program and integrate mobile or remote learning solutions.UNFPA Achievements: In 2024, UNFPA's support reached 89,630 adolescents and girls through the Safe Spaces and mentorship programmes, and 10,869 adolescents and women through livelihood programmes integrating socio-economic empowerment and SRHR. Innovation and digital solutions for Life Skills and Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) were applied and scaled such as in-school CSE using digital tablets and apps; a total of 31,301 adolescents benefited from the support.

The implementation of these measures is already underway in Ghana, thanks to NTF V support. In particular:Successful collaboration with the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) on key policy concerns that affect the cocoa sector, including climate change, ageing trees, ageing cocoa farmers as well as requirements stemming from the EU directives on deforestation and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D).We facilitated the establishment of the National Task Force, comprising public and private stakeholders (20+ partners), to develop an action plan for Ghana's cocoa value chain in response to the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D). The task force provides technical guidance to value chain actors to effectively align and demonstrate the alignment of their domestic policy and regulatory frameworks with the requirements of the EU CS3D.COCOBOD is piloting more sustainable cocoa production systems, involving reforestation through dynamic agroforestry (DAF) to enhance climate resilience, productivity and boost incomes of smallholder cocoa farmers.Supported Kuapa Kokoo Farmers' Union (KKFU), a Fairtrade-certified cooperative with over 100,000 members, in designing and implementing a digital pilot that leverages innovative agritech solutions to enhance traceability and streamline operations.

Efforts focused on equipping COCOBOD, private institutions, and agribusinesses in beneficiary countries with action plans to help farmers, cooperatives, and other value chain actors align with regulations and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Additionally, through the A4A multi-stakeholder approach, Ghanaian cocoa farmers adopted the Dynamic Agroforestry (DAF) system, endorsed by the CEO of COCOBOD in 2024, ensuring the institutionalization of the approach for wider impact and sustainability beyond the project.      II.           Strengthening Public-Private Alliances and Support EcosystemsPartnerships were reinforced, particularly with private sector actors such as HALBA, to promote sustainable cocoa production, empower cooperatives, and improve smallholder resilience.

Promoting Agritech adoption to enhance resilience and competitiveness of agribusinesses The digital pilot with KKFU (a Fairtrade-certified cooperative with over 100,000 members) launched in 2023, was successfully completed, leading to enhanced operational efficiency and traceability. The integration of KKSys, SmartFarm Plus, TeleAgric, and Survey123 transitioned KKFU from fragmented, manual data management to a cloud-based system covering production, farm data collection, and delivery models. This shift facilitated real-time data collection, digital farm mapping, and transaction monitoring across an estimated 120,392 hectares of cocoa farmland. As a result, data on 58,724 farmers, including 20,171 women and 4,434 youth, was collected, verified, and uploaded into the new system, , ensuring compliance with international sustainability standards, particularly relevant for EUDR requirements.

By making structured data available to national institutions, this center facilitates evidence-based policymaking, resource mobilization, strategic planning, and both internal and external control mechanisms. Furthermore, the UNDP is supporting the National Assembly in creating the necessary environmental conditions to host a dedicated data center, further strengthening institutional digital capabilities.Efforts to modernize and streamline administrative processes extend to various governmental entities.

Thirty two percent of Kenya‚Äôs population of 47,7 million resides in urban areas and the urban population is growing at an alarming rate of 4.3 per annum. Kenya‚Äôs urban poor constitute 52% of the total poor population while on the other hand, the urban areas in Kenya contribute approximately 65% of the Gross National Income making sustainable urbanization a priority in Kenya to achieve its development objectives set out in the Big Four Agenda and the SDGs. Land is the primary basis for investment and economic development in Kenya. It is limited in nature, 68% lack land documentation or tenure security and concerned authorities continue to struggle to put in place measures through the NLIMS to improve its management in a transparent and fair manner. Housing on the other hand is a basic human right but there is an annual deficit of 250,000 units due to affordability challenges, lack of sustainable funding and unavailability of land for housing by many urban poor.

With support from UNDP the Observatory Hub, an online database that collects and tracks SGBV cases was expanded to two additional districts. The Hub supports the justice and security sector to address SGBV, keep track of crime hotspots, ensure referrals for psychosocial support and 12,020 have been uploaded and tracked since its establishment. Similarly, the establishment of virtual courts (e-courts) has expanded access to justice and particularly enables survivors of SGBV to testify remotely, thereby reducing revictimization.Decentralization: Financial and technical support was provided for digitizing two urban development plans. Ward Action Plans, Urban Profiles and Urban Development Plans for Mangochi and Kasungu municipals respectively have been developed. Technical support was provided to Mwanza District Council for development of a Local Revenue Management Information System (LORMIS). The LORMIS has facilitated substantial revenue growth for the district. The LORMIS has become one of the effective Revenue Management Reforms recognized by the Office of the Vice President.Health supply chain strengthening: Adopted an open source health supply chain system from UNDP Indonesia to ensure sustainability with 10,310 health dispensation points2.1.2b: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and National ID: UNDP has been actively supporting the National Registration Bureau (NRB) in Malawi through both technical and financial assistance to enhance the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system and the National ID system. This collaborative effort aims to establish a comprehensive, continuous, and universal legal identity framework that ensures the protection and promotion of fundamental rights, including the rights of children.To date, the NRB has successfully registered 12.7 million adults aged 16 years and above for the National ID, marking significant progress in ensuring a robust identity system. Recognizing the importance of continuous child registration as a critical component of CRVS, UNDP has provided technical support to NRB to expand birth registration services. This includes equipping 56 health facilities with the capability to issue birth certificates before parents leave the facility. This initiative not only facilitates timely registration but also ensures that children receive legal recognition from birth.However, the registration of children aged 0 to 16 years who are yet to be covered remains a priority. To address this, UNDP, in collaboration with UNICEF, has developed a concept note outlining a strategy to achieve universal child registration. The proposed plan, set for implementation in 2025, aims to assign all Malawian children a unique identifier, thereby ensuring that every child is accounted for within the legal identity system. This comprehensive approach underscores the commitment of UNDP and its partners to building an inclusive identity framework that safeguards rights, fosters equitable access to services, and supports national development objectives.2.1.2. c. Support inclusive digital transformation, that strengthens the digital public infrastructure, digital governance and reduced the digital divide:UNDP is driving inclusive digital transformation in Malawi by strengthening digital infrastructure, enhancing governance, and reducing the digital divide. In collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Digitalisation, UNDP has conducted a digital readiness assessment and is supporting the development of a national digital strategy.The Inclusive Digital Transformation for Malawi (IDT4M) project, implemented with UNDP support, leverages digital infrastructure to improve service access, enhance governance, and boost socioeconomic development. Key achievements include 98% national coverage of digital identity systems, skills training through partnerships like Microsoft and public universities, and fostering open-source solutions as part of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA).UNDP also supports sectoral integration, such as enabling digitally signed QR codes for beneficiary verification with the Ministry of Agriculture and using national IDs for voter registration with the Malawi Electoral Commission. These initiatives promote efficiency, transparency, and inclusion, laying the foundation for a sustainable digital future in Malawi.UNICEFKey Achievements: Through the National Local Government Finance Committee (NLGFC) and National Planning Commission (NPC) supported the capacity building of all 28 districts on district program-based budgeting (PBB) and alignment to MIP-1 and MW2063.ÔªøOpportunities: Digitalize local governance systems and expand training programs for government officials.",11600000.0,7865866.33,5027874.89,UNECASupported Malawi to review and develop its Foreign Policy document and its Strategic Plan and to develop a performance management dashboard which was operationalized accoring to the needs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

On 11-12 January 2024, Ethiopia made a significant leap towards enhancing its data governance capabilities through a second workshop supported by DESA.

Increased rate of case disposal from 60 % to 75 % has been achieved as a result of different interventions that include Alternative Dispute Resolution, Plea bargaining programme, the small claims procedure and use of e-governance have significantly supported the reduction of case backlog from 27% (in 2023) to 27.48% (in 2024) in the justice system. Additionally, UNDP supported the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) initiative in Eastern, Western and Central Uganda through skilling and accreditation of 96 mediators (46F/50M) in partnership with the Judiciary. As a result, marginalized groups gained affordable access to justice and were able to realize their human rights.

Through the project, the following successes were documented.Enhanced Critical Thinking and Creativity: students, boys and girls are now thinking critically and creatively, collaborating effectively ‚Äì demonstrated through practical efforts showcased to solve real-life problems as well as such as developing websites, games, and other applications independently. Students have produced projects that have potential to address real life challenges ‚Äì through use of Artificial Intelligence like at Euthini Secondary School. Creation of E library to access learning and study materials, which is anticipated to achieve improved academic performance through use of ICT ‚Äì case of Mvera CDSS. Mvera CDSS has no Library but through internet connectivity and tablets provided by UN Women, the school has utilised this and students are accessing e-library services, thus producing a multiplier effect beyond students learning computer coding, gender and entrepreneurship using the same gadgets.Reduced Absenteeism: Students are motivated to attend school more consistently, reducing absenteeism with many students registering to participate in the coding, gender entrepreneurship training sessions in the innovation hubs established in their respective schools.Infrastructure Improvements: Installation of Starlink and solar grids at Mpilisi CDSS enables internet access and night study, helping bridge the digital divide and inspire students toward technology-related careers. The provision of tablets, internet connectivity, capacity building of 20 secondary school teachers on facilitation of coding training, the development of coding training manual as well as the development of a coding learning management system have set or improved infrastructure for coding training in secondary schools.UNICEFKey Achievements: UNICEF Malawi has made significant strides in advancing quality and inclusive education. In 2024, 20,329 double-seater desks were delivered, benefiting 81,316 primary school learners (40,658 girls) and improving classroom environments. The development of the National Education Policy and the EMIS Governance Framework enhanced education sector management, emphasizing data-driven decision-making and effective policy implementation. To support early childhood education, UNICEF facilitated the phased introduction of pre-primary classes for 5-year-olds in public schools. Preparatory activities included nationwide consultations, school mapping, and the development of a play-based curriculum. An ECE Costing and Financing Study provided a roadmap for expanding pre-primary education. UNICEF also scaled up the Teacher Mentorship Program, developing a comprehensive framework and training 410 trainers through 11 Teacher Training Colleges. The e-CPD platform was strengthened, enabling remote teacher training, with 70 education officials trained to support its use, advancing digital literacy. Through the Connect-a-School initiative, 18 schools were connected to the internet, benefiting 15,566 learners (50% girls) and 503 teachers. Additionally, 8,266 schools were mapped under the GIGA initiative, enabling data-driven digital education planning. ICT infrastructure upgrades were also implemented in key schools, including Kamwanya, Chayamba, Salima, Mwanza, Machinga, Kachanga, Misuku, Maghemo, and Kaweche. These efforts, supported by the GPE-funded Tech4Ed initiative, highlight UNICEF‚Äôs commitment to leveraging technology to improve access, quality, and continuity in educationChallenges: Low to none internet connectivity in rural schools and high student-to-teacher ratios in primary schools limit the school's capacity to deliver digital education.Opportunities: Expand digital education initiatives and promote innovative teacher training methods.UNESCOIn the spirit of Leaving No One Behind, UNESCO advanced disability-inclusive LSE, working with the MoE to provide support to the Montfort Special Needs Education College (MSNEC) to review the current LSE course outline. This collaboration is aimed at making the LSE content more practical and needs-driven, for instance through introducing ideas to create disability-inclusive teaching and learning aids using locally available materials. Additionally, UNESCO began engaging inclusive education coordinators, who are stationed in each district across the country and are mandated to support teachers at resource centres within their districts. These coordinators were sensitized on inclusive LSE, building on lessons learned from the training-of-trainers (TOT) workshop on the Breaking the Silence (BtS) approach to CSE for teachers of learners with disabilities conducted in Malawi in 2021.Numbers reached:40 Resource Coordinators (26 male, 14 female)UNHCR: In 2024, UNHCR and its partners supported government efforts in education by providing staff and resource support to over 16,000 children and youth across preschool, primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Homeland Security, UNHCR ensured that both forcibly displaced and host community children around Dzaleka Refugee Camp had access to inclusive, quality, and age-appropriate education.Key activities included the provision of teaching and learning materials, funding for teaching staff, school maintenance and furniture renovations, and teacher capacity-building initiatives. Additionally, support was extended through post-secondary and tertiary education scholarships. Regular engagement with education authorities and local communities further promoted social cohesion and coexistence between nationals and forcibly displaced populations.",12119646.0,9279059.96,7820270.62,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
