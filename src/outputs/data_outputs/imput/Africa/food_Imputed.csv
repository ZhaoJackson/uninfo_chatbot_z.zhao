An enabling policy environment is a key element for agricultural development, food security and poverty reduction in developing countries. However, government policy analysts and decision makers often lack the capacity to generate reliable evidence of the impact of their policies on value chain actors, from farmers to consumers. Therefore, government policies and the effects they generate are often inconsistent with overarching food security and agricultural development goals. FAO through MAFAP successfully collaborated with government institutions and research organizations, to create policy-monitoring systems and carry out a consistent set of policy and public expenditure analyses across a wide range of agricultural value chains. MAFAP is building on the partnerships and evidence created to support the governments to reform food and agricultural policies that are currently constraining agricultural development, especially for smallholders._x000D_

FAO interventions under the programme, focus on improving agricultural productivity through promoting Climate Smart Agriculture, creating access to knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices, access to high quality inputs that are adapted to local conditions such as climate conditions and pest and disease pressure, to increase the productivity of identified crops (Maize, Cassava and Beans). FAO continues to play a critical role in providing technical support through advocating for the implementation of the Tanzania Agriculture and Climate Resilience Plan (ACRP) and Climate Smart Agriculture Programme to mitigate risks, set priorities for action and investment and build a foundation for resilience in the agriculture sector especially for vulnerable communities. This reiterates the government‚Äôs commitment to make the agricultural sector climate-smart by 2030. A comprehensive training package on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) emphasizing on Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) for crop production will entail on/off farm practices that address environmental, economic and social sustainability aspects along the supply chain, which results to safe and quality food and non-food products. This will enable farmers to become resilient to climate shock. Emphasis will also be placed on nutrition-sensitive agriculture to address the double burden of malnutrition in the region.The CSA guideline will be used as an instructive tool for informing extension staff and farmers on mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation co-beneficial objectives within agriculture development. More particularly, it will provide guidance on CSA practices and technologies best suited for Kigoma region and the agro-climatic zone. It will also target district development planners and extension agents to plan and budget for agricultural development, and to facilitate community level planning; and extension agents to sensitize, mobilize and train smallholder farmers to adopt agricultural practices considered climate-smart. Additionally, FAO will train smallholder farmers on improved beekeeping practices as an important livelihood strategy for income generating with very high potential for improving income, especially for communities living close to forests and woodlands. Beekeeping development also has a potential of contributing to self-employment, enhancing agricultural production, promoting and the conservation of the environment.FAO interventions will focus on the following outputs for the next four years: - Strengthening group cohesion and building producer organizations through Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and Junior Farmer Field Learning Schools (JFFLS)- Training on good agriculture practices and Climate Smart Agriculture practices for selected commodities including maize, beans, cassava and livestock production- Procurement and distribution of agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizer, herbicides/pesticides, vaccines) and tools.- Disseminate information about different and appropriate varieties of maize, beans and cassava and livestock through various channels including community radios, school JFFLS and FFS programmes.- Promote and train Beekeeping as a viable enterprise (incl. dissemination of information via community radio)- Develop and implement integrated landscape management plans in the project area/ agricultural zone",2017-03-01,2022-06-30,Implementation,-,-,FAO,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; The Tanzania One Fund,Kakonko DC; Kasulu DC; Kasulu TC; Kibondo DC; Kigoma RAS; LGAs; MATI Mubondo; MOA; MicroLoan Foundation; PO-RALG,"1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.,2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and nonfarm employment.,2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.",1 No Poverty; 2 Zero Hunger,"Tanzania, United Republic of; ",-,-,-,1 - Contributes to gender equality/women's empowerment in a limited way,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,,2759164.23,1796576.3,1448975.0,551832.846,441013.86,357039.43,-,578817.0,512266.74,443417.86,-,317198.29,262048.84,193365.43,-,753730.0,554621.22,438308.14,-,576667.94,488816.3,415377.78,-,532751.0,422516.89,321446.35,-,551832.846,476156.31,400051.35,-,551832.846,489643.49,438688.91,-,551832.846,476730.28,401285.73,-,551832.846,418962.78,338822.55,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

In March 2021, WFP supported the conduct of the Food Security and Post-Harvest Assessment which revealed that the food security situation in Liberia is dire, with an estimated 2.4 million people moderately or severely food insecure (45 percent and 5 percent of the population, respectively), an increase of 50 percent since the last assessment in September 2020. In April of the same year, WFP conducted a livelihood assessment in concession areas in four counties (Grand Cape Mount, Nimba, Sinoe and Maryland). The assessment  revealed that 69 percent of residents in concession areas depend on their own production and sale of crops for income generation. The study also found that 52 percent of the respondent‚Äôs household heads have no formal school education and 75 percent of household heads‚Äô spouses have also never attended school. This lack of formal education makes it difficult to engage in formal employment, thus making agriculture the key livelihood source for many households engaged in the production of cassava, rubber, rice, vegetables, etc. WFP also conducted a market functionality index that revealed prevailing situations in 57 local markets in terms of price of commodities, accessibility, availability, etc.
A nationwide RAPID FOOD SECURITY NUTRITION, LIVELIHOODS  AND MARKETS ASSESSMENT (RFSNLMA 2022) was conducted by WFP, FAO, UNICEF and WHO in all 15 counties, 112 districts and Monrovia (urban Montserrado) with 4,160 randomly selected households interviewed, Middle Upper Arm Circumference of 1,213 children (6 to 59 months) measured and their mothers interviewed for morbidity 334 mothers with children 6 to 23 months interviewed for dietary diversity,  4131 women interviewed for dietary diversity FGDs in 34 markets and 383 traders interviewed.

The goal was to pinpoint existing deficiencies and suggest measures to bolster the ministry's dedication to gender mainstreaming, in accordance with the Labour Laws of Liberia. The gender audit consultant examined key elements that support gender mainstreaming, including the effectiveness of leadership, the execution of the Gender and Social Inclusion Policy framework, the allocation of financial resources, and the technical expertise for gender analysis. A detailed report and policy brief were produced from the gender audit, outlining the findings and recommendations. This provided a summary of the audit's extent, methods, and proposed steps to amplify the MoL's ability to implement gender mainstreaming at every level.In addition, UN Women‚Äôs Digital Inclusion for Women‚Äôs Economic Empowerment (D4WEE) Project, assessed from October to December 2023, demonstrated strategic planning and partnerships, notably with the Orange Foundation and the Central Bank of Liberia, leading to sustainable empowerment.

However, challenges persist, including limited access to credit, lack of training opportunities, and the need for a comprehensive WEE policy. Key Findings:Care Economy: Limited awareness and knowledge about the care economy. Lack of data and formal structures. Insufficient government intervention. Green and Blue Economies: Lack of training in understanding the green and blue economies. Limited awareness about the green and blue economies among women business leaders. Lack of special financing funds to support women's participation in the green and blue economies. Financial Inclusion, Entrepreneurship, and Trade: Limited credit facilities and high interest rates. Lack of property to guarantee loan payments and bureaucratic bottlenecks. Limited knowledge on AfCFTA and cross-border trade opportunities. Lack of women empowerment and entrepreneurship development policy. Recommendations:Develop a National Care Policy and establish a care taskforce. Conduct a time-use survey and develop a care roadmap. Reskill and upskill training for women's participation in the green and blue economies. Provide technical assistance for gender-responsive policies. Engage women in waste management and provide disaster resilience financial support. Organize a national women empowerment policy dialogue. Collaborate with CBL to provide support for WEE. Develop a Women Economic Empowerment Policy. Next Steps:Continue to advocate for increased government intervention in the care economy. Support the development of gender-responsive policies in the green and blue economies. Work with financial institutions to improve access to credit for women entrepreneurs. Facilitate training and awareness-raising on WEE, cross-border trade, and AfCFTA.

Their internal review process has considered the integration of gender considerations into disaster preparedness and response strategies. The Gender Unit has transitioned to a Gender Department, now led by a Gender Director and an Assistant Gender Director.

The recommendations from this assessment, once implemented, are expected to reduce gender disparities, particularly for women and youth, and contribute to sustainable peace. Next, inter-agency collaboration has been strengthened, facilitating the alignment of gender goals across national development strategies. This has contributed to increased advocacy for gender equality and has influenced positive shifts in national budget discussions. A notable outcome includes a measurable increase in gender-specific budget allocations in key sectors such as health, education, and social protection.

The women are also practicing nutrition-sensitive agriculture demonstrated by their growing of different varieties of vegetables.  

WFP - 750 smallholder farmers received different training to enhance sustainable agriculture production and input support which helped them to adopt climate smart agriculture practices to increase production. Vulnerable farmer organizations resilience capacity strengthened through providing them with training, agricultural inputs, and machinery support to increase production and value addition.
Additionally, WFP created market access to smallholders farmer groups through purchase of locally grown food commodities (861.91 MT) at the value of US$1,900,000.00. This helped to boost agriculture production of smallholder farmers including increasing household incomes and improve food access for smallholder famers and families .

In 2025, UN Women is providing a total of 82,000 USD (Activity ID: 2.1.3) to support communities in Liberia to increase productivity, enhance sustainable livelihoods, resilience capacities, social inclusion, financial inclusion, and food and nutrition security. This support aligns with ""Activity ID: 2.1.3: Support communities to increase productivity, enhance sustainable livelihoods, resilience capacities, social inclusion, financial inclusion, food and nutrition security, including the provision of agri-equipment, pre & post-harvest management training, etc"" and encompasses several key initiatives.

Firstly, efforts to strengthen agricultural productivity and sustainability include Solar Power Agri-Equipment Support for Women Cooperatives, receiving two grants totaling 19,000 USD (14,000 USD from the UN Women HQ small grant and 5,000 USD from UN Women). This aims to enhance agricultural practices through the adoption of sustainable energy solutions. Secondly, promoting financial inclusion is addressed through Financial Inclusion Support for Women Cooperatives, allocated a budget of 20,000 USD from UN Women to improve women's access to formal financial services. A significant component focuses on Empowering Rural and Young Women through Capacity Building, with a budget of 25,000 USD from UN Women. This initiative targets women from UN Women-supported networks (e.g., NRWS, NaPHWoL, AWICBT, LMA, etc.) and will provide training in financial inclusion, green and blue economies, entrepreneurship and trade, care economy awareness and formalization, and digital literacy skills.

Furthermore, leveraging digital platforms and centers is a key strategy, with Scaling Up the Buy from Women Digital Platform and Establishing Digital Centers supported by a 10,000 USD budget from UN Women. This will enhance the digital platform and expand access to digital literacy and support centers. Building climate resilience and leadership is addressed through NDC 3.0 Training for Youth and Gender Climate Working Group, allocated 5,000 USD from UN Women for capacity building in climate action. Finally, Capacity Development on Organizational Development and Leadership Skills with AWICBT will receive 3,000 USD from UN Women to strengthen the organization.

These interconnected initiatives demonstrate UN Women's commitment in 2025 to fostering holistic and sustainable development for women in Liberia, aligning with the broader goals of increased productivity, enhanced livelihoods, and greater resilience.

WFP:
WFP is supporting 2,900 SHFs from 65 farmer groups in Grand Cape, Grand Bassa, Grand Gedeh, Bong, Nimba, Lofa, and Gbarpolu Counties. These farmers are receiving climate smart agriculture training, farmer tool and equipment (Power tillers, rice mills, cassava processors etc.), including storage and agri business facilities. WFP Liberia has linked these SHFs to its Home-Grown School Feeding Programme thus creating market access. The 2,900 SHFs received food assistance through value voucher redemption process from retailers. 300 hectares of lowland rice and vegetables are under cultivation.

As a result of this intervention, all 264 (females: 158 and males: 106) of them are now involved in livelihood activities through business plans financing. This has led to resilience livelihood of these beneficiaries for sustainable and inclusive economic and human development. UN Women has made a significant impact on the lives of over 1,200 female farmers across Lofa, Bong, and Nimba Counties by providing them with the tools and knowledge necessary to enhance their productivity and ensure sustainable livelihoods. Through comprehensive capacity-building programs, these women have been educated in disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies, resource governance, and environmental preservation, equipping them to better manage their resources and protect their local ecosystems.Moreover, UN Women‚Äôs financial inclusion initiatives have been instrumental in breaking down barriers to credit access for these female farmers. By enabling them to secure loans, these women have been able to make meaningful agricultural investments, which in turn has led to the establishment of thriving agri-businesses. This entrepreneurial leap has not only bolstered their economic stability but has also contributed to the overall prosperity of their communities.The specialized training provided by UN Women has empowered these women to launch and manage successful agri-businesses, fostering a sense of social inclusion and community spirit. The result is a more resilient community where food security is enhanced, and women are key drivers of economic growth and environmental stewardship. This holistic approach by UN Women has laid the foundation for a future where female farmers are not just participants but leaders in creating a more productive and sustainable agricultural sector.IFAD: In 2023, IFAD funded projects including TCEP, TCEP-II and BCRP supported 11,366 (TCEP=4,089, TCEP-II=5,333, BCRP=1,944)smallholder farmers in cocoa production, of which 9,422 benefitted from replacement program while 1,944 benefitted under the BCRP as new beneficiaries. Cumulatively , the IFAD funded projects have supported about 18,953 smallholder cocoa farmers, with female constituting 31% and youth 32% respectively.As a result of the project support to these farmers in 2023, about 5,197 hectares are under cultivation using climate resilience practices in cocoa production. To date, about 10483.88 hectares under cultivation for cocoa production under the three projects. For improved and climate resilience agriculture practices, trainings were conducted for Lead Farmers using the Farmers' Field School approach. To increase production, IFAD project distributed agricultural inputs to 5,627 smallholder farmers to enhance sustainable livelihoods and address food security concerns.

The provision of improved hybrid cocoa seeds provides the foundation for improving productivity. In 2024, additional 2 ha were planted with 2,222 at the National Cocoa Seed Garden, bringing the total of 18 ha out of 19 ha currently being cultivated with about 19,998 cocoa trees planted. the National COcoa Seed Garden in Nimba will play a critical role of providing high yielding planting material for Liberian cocoa farmers. Productivity under the STAR Project has improved significantly with farmer groups of 4,620 smallholders cultiviting some 840ha of rice and achieving higher yields ranging from 3 to 4ton/ha. Under the Building Climate Resilience Project, about 4,120 rice farmers (1,257 male adults, 1,008 female adults, 934 male youth, and 921 female youth) have benefited from agro-inputs, development of lowlands, training on good agronomic practices and technical support and cultivate some 279 ha of Inland valley swampland (IVS). In addition to the development of IVS, the project has provided 25 sets of rice mills aimed at reducing post-harvest losses and decreasing manual labor. Additionally, 52 power tillers and other production inputs have been supplied, as well as technical training in rice production. IFAD projects also work with lead farmers to provide technical advisory services to farmers. In 2024 about 120 lead farmers were trained bringing to about 684 lead farmers trained trained and providing community level extension advisory services to farmers in their communities. WFP - 750 smallholder farmers received different training to enhance sustainable agriculture production and input support which helped them to adopt climate smart agriculture practices to increase production. Vulnerable farmer organizations resilience capacity strengthened through providing them with training, agricultural inputs, and machinery support to increase production and value addition. Additionally, WFP created market access to smallholders farmer groups through purchase of locally grown food commodities (861.91 MT) at the value of US$1,700,000.00. This helped to boost agriculture production of smallholder farmers including increase in household incomes and improve food access for smallholder famers and families .UN Women has focused on supporting rural communities in Liberia to increase productivity, enhance sustainable livelihoods and build resilience. Recognizing the disproportionate impact of economic shocks and natural disasters on women, interventions have included:Disaster Preparedness and Resilience: Training on risk management and access to early warning systems have been provided to enhance community resilience, with a particular focus on empowering women to take an active role in disaster preparedness and response.Improved Livelihoods and Productivity: The introduction of solar-powered equipment and clean cooking technologies has not only improved the quality of life for rural women by reducing time spent on domestic tasks and mitigating health risks associated with traditional cooking methods but also increased their productivity by enabling income-generating activities and supporting food security.These initiatives have contributed to broader efforts to promote social inclusion and ensure food and nutrition security within rural communities, ultimately empowering women and strengthening their ability to cope with economic and environmental challenges.UNDP: Inter-agency collaboration has been strengthened, facilitating the alignment of gender goals across national development strategies. This has contributed to increased advocacy for gender equality and has influenced positive shifts in national budget discussions. A notable outcome includes a measurable increase in gender-specific budget allocations in key sectors such as health, education, and social protection. Overall, the intervention has laid a solid foundation for sustained institutional commitment to gender equality and more inclusive governance at the national level.",9481287.0,6617250.46,5120765.81,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

The multisectoral programme was delivered in ‚Äòat risk‚Äô zones identified in Yobe state informed by the high prevalence of stunting (60 %) and level of food insecurity. The project focused on a multisectoral approach with a particular emphasis on the integration of CBT for nutrition and livelihoods.  The integrated nutrition and livelihood programme targeted children 6-23 months and PLW. The integration, however, was implemented in only one of the 4 targeted wards of Bade LGA. As part of the enrolment process, it was ensured that the children possessed immunization cards and the pregnant women ANC card in other to enhance uptake of these services in the health facilities. The programme was planned to kickstart in April 2021 to March 2022. However, the actual cash transfers to beneficiaries commenced in July 2021. Beneficiaries registered in the programme received NGN7,000 in the form of e-vouchers on monthly basis.  The programme reached 36765 beneficiaries (46%) of the planned target of 80,000 (children an PLW).

Challenges 

Setting up nutrition e-voucher programme and identification of beneficiaries based on the targeting criteria contributed to the late start and lower than expected achievement.

In 2021, UNICEF continued its efforts to support operationalizing and mainstreaming humanitarian cash 
programming. UNICEF concluded the implementation of the voucher project which focused on provision of hygiene 
materials in response to COVID-195,180 households received vouchers to access soap and a hand washing bucket in Aweil, Bor and Bentiu counties. In addition, 1106 extremely vulnerable households in Bor and Malakal received
unconditional cash assistance to cover their basic needs. The households for the unconditional cash support project were identified and registered by UNICEF through a collaborative effort with local partners and community leaders. A part of the WASH voucher pilot in the Juba Protection of Civilian (POC) site, 9,125 households were registered on the SCOPE platform who will be targeted to be assisted to access water through a voucher modality in collaboration with WFP. The greatest challenge in 2021 was the continued depreciation of the SSP against the dollar, resulting in the rising price of basic commodities and reduced purchasing power for vulnerable households targeted with cash programmes

They have been able to make a profit. Also, the SLAs are not just about increasing income or serving as a social protection fund, they have also empowered the women to become active players in their various communities.

At least 35,110 houses have been totally destroyed (3,805) or partially destroyed (31,305). The government reported that thousands of hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed, nearing and at harvest time, which will affect the food security in months to come.

In line with government priorities and request for assistance, the intervention will focus on the districts Macomia, Quissangua and Ibo, which have been severely impacted. Further government rapid assessments are underway, and geographical and beneficiary targeting might be adjusted as soon as more data becomes available.

According to some beneficiaries in Gbedin Community in Nimba County, the project has been transformative and a game changer helping them to prepare their farm land for planting which has been traditionally exhausting and time-consuming. However, with the availability of tractors and other farming equipment, the farmers are now doing everything in one step, thereby saving time and energy. For example, in Nimba County alone, over 230 acres were cultivated with the help of the tractors and other farming equipment, thereby increasing food production, harvesting 1,750 bags of rice with limited labor. With the supply of the farming equipment, this community is now one of the leading supplier of seed rice for smallholder farmers across Liberia. To further enhance agricultural productivity, the ACDP procured and handed over 16 YAMAHA motorbikes to the Ministry of Agriculture.

Through the‚ÄØvirtual farmers market project, WFP trained 7,997 smallholder farmers (42%‚ÄØwomen)‚ÄØon agricultural practices, financial literacy, and a balanced diet. In addition, WFP raised people's consciousness about the importance of eating healthy through social and behavior change communication programmes, reaching 2,947 local farmers (39% women).In an effort to reduce PHL, the WFP Zero loss Initiative (ZLI) was expanded to 24 districts. WFP began hosting roundtable discussions in many provinces to promote understanding of post-harvest losses and the value of hermetic technology in reducing these losses resulting, the capacity of 117 government employees were improved, allowing them to better train 8,282 smallholder farmers (54%‚ÄØwomen). Furthermore, 6,244 hermetic bags were provided to 3,122 smallholder farmers.Through AGROPONTO in Nampula, WFP aimed to facilitate smallholder famers‚Äô remote access to market. To implement the platforms, 6 government employees were trained and provided instruction to 800 lead farmers (34%‚ÄØwomen) and supplied 798 kits containing smartphones, solar chargers, and weighing scales to 400 additional farmers. Similarly, another digital platform called Farm2Go was launched in Tete as well and improved the capacity of 13 government employees, 6 purchasers, and 8 lead farmers to encourage smallholder farmers' engagement and usage of the platform.                                                                                           The second 6 months of 2022, WFP implemented our initiatives‚ÄØthat support‚ÄØfarm production and livelihoods‚ÄØunder the Beyond Cotton Project. A total of 131 smallholder farmers (38%‚ÄØwomen) and 24 technicians from the cooperating partners were involved. For the agricultural campaign of 2022/2023, agricultural kits‚ÄØwere acquired to assist 250 farmers.  Through our‚ÄØVirtual Farmers Project, 1,681 households were educated about NutriSIM, 12 communities (1 campaign per community) participated to improve nutritional intake. WFP used community radios‚ÄØto air 790 radio spots, 60 radio soap operas, and 12 debates, which emphasized the value of eating a diversified diet rich-in-nutrient. WFP signed contracts with 24 SDAEs‚ÄØas part of its ZLI, wherein 779 government workers had their post-harvest management skills improved. Throughout 266 workshops, WFP educated 7,597 smallholder farmers (38%‚ÄØwomen) on PHM and the use of hermetic technology. WFP sent out 1,2000 hermetic bags to 474 farmers(45% women) and signed a long-term deal with PLASTEX (a national supplier of hermetic silos).WFP gave 30 scales and 30 moisture meters to the selected farmers to serve as leaders, then capacitated‚ÄØ806 farmer organizations to reduce post-harvest losses and increase market access by working via lead farmers. WFP supported 2,774 farmers(41% women), use local procurement methods to sell their products. Further, WFP helped 4,433 smallholder farmers market 4,071.42 MT of agricultural crops, valued at USD 1,725,091.03 (50% women).

A total of 1,240 000 women smallholder farmers enhanced their knowledge on  cooperative management and financial literacy. The women were grouped into 35 women-led farmers‚Äô cooperatives (with an average of 25 women per cooperative) which are now registered with relevant government agencies in the state. Additionally, linkages of the women farmers‚Äô cooperatives to financial institutions were facilitated to ensure financial inclusion.  The cooperatives have created an access to finance platform which allows them to build up petty trades. Women farmers have reported that the cooperative group helped them to become socially and economically empowered by supporting them to produce more as a group, diversify their businesses (especially in the agro-processing sector), earn better income, raise living standards, and contribute to food security of families and communities at large. Women farmers who have diversified their businesses to the level of agribusinesses were further capacitated on agribusiness strategies. Overall, through the establishment and trainings of women farmers‚Äô cooperatives, the project has created jobs and generated income for an estimated 1,380 women smallholder farmers by fostering their transition from less formal to decent and sustainable work. Majority of women participating in the project have reported increased access to opportunities that enhanced their economic and food security status in the context of conflict,  humanitarian crisis and climate change. The project also consolidated partnerships with relevant actors (including banks of agriculture) who contributed to creating an enabling environment for women economic empowerment, including through the facilitation of legal registration of women farmers‚Äô cooperatives . The opening of banks accounts for women farmers and their cooperatives contributed to bridging the wide gender gap that existed between men and women farmers, and promoted women smallholder farmers in terms of ability to access social security, financial schemes and other agriculture input/programmes.

39,573 Households had their Food Security improved through access to improved crop inputs, fish processing facilities and irrigation infrastructure (water pumps and tube wells/wash boreholes) as well as livestock kits including goats and poultry. The beneficiaries were among the vulnerable households in 13 LGAs of Borno state who are mostly women households.The support was provided between January and December of 2021 across LGAs in Borno  state. FAO partnered with government through Borno ADP and NGOs in the delivery of the project activities. The target beneficiaries were vulnerable members of host community, IDPs and returnees and included men and women households. Assessment of impact on crop input beneficiaries indicates improvement in food security outcomes of the beneficiary households. Farmers were able to produce food that will last for an average of 4.2 months and significantly improves food consumption score. Over 3 quarter (77 percent) of the sampled beneficiaries have acceptable FCS.
Assessment of impact of livestock assistance show evidence of increased household income to the benefiting households and enabled them diversify their income source using proceeds from sales of livestock and products.

ÔªøIn total, 24,405 smallholder farmers, organised in farmer groups, supplied food commodities to the schools, helping to create a stable market for their produce and improving the local economy. Additionally, 44,951 small holder farmers benefitted from the homegrown school feeding programme through various interventions including trainings on agricultural practices, including post-harvest loss mitigation and crop diversification. UNICEF Key Achievements: UNICEF scaled up high-impact, equitable nutrition interventions in Malawi by leveraging food, health, education, social protection, and WASH systems. Over 1.5 million children were screened for wasting, with 40,811 treated, while vitamin A and micronutrient supplementation improved child nutrition. Nutrition-sensitive social protection programs, such as cash transfers targeting households with children under two, and community-based Care Groups engaged local volunteers to promote health and nutrition practices. UNICEF enhanced dietary diversity through initiatives like distributing chickens, fruit trees, and supporting backyard gardens for over 90,000 households. Education systems were leveraged to deliver iron and folate supplements to adolescent girls and establish school health clubs addressing nutrition, hygiene, and gender-sensitive practices. WASH systems ensured access to safe water for 1.41 million people and improved sanitation for over 110,000 individuals, contributing to disease prevention. Through the First Foods Africa Initiative, nutrient-enriched crops, food processing training, and innovative supplements like fish powder were introduced to diversify diets. UNICEF‚Äôs efforts aligned with the national Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection framework, promoting cross-sector collaboration for sustainable outcomes. These integrated interventions strengthened resilience and addressed malnutrition among vulnerable populations, demonstrating a holistic, multi-system approach to improving child nutrition and well-being.Challenges: Insufficient coverage of nutrition-sensitive interventions in remote areas.Opportunities: UNICEF considers leveraging on school systems and community networks to improve dietary practices and address malnutrition sustainably.WHO: WHO has contributed to the enhancement of the health systems capacity to improve the quality of inpatient care for children with severe malnutrition through the training and mentorship of over 60 health care workers from nutrition rehabilitation units in 15 districts worst affected by disasters on the management of children admitted with severe malnutrition and the provision of PED-SAM kits to 18 districts. Furthermore, WHO has supported the evaluation of the implementation of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiave Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding who findings will inform national policy and programming to protect, promote and support breastfeeding.",24195496.0,21524721.04,16301147.18,"In line with the Government‚Äôs objective to increase the coverage of school meals from 43 percent to 100 percent by 2030, WFP made significant progress in scaling up the HGSF programme in 2024. WFP extended its support to 200 additional schools across three new districts: Mzimba (North and South), Nkhatabay, and Rumphi. Furthermore, 34 schools in Chikwawa and Nsanje were added, and 78 Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres were included in the programme. This expansion brought the total number of primary schools supported to 778, up from 544 the previous year. A total of 837,026 primary school learners (426,127 girls and 410,899 boys) benefited from daily nutritious meals. These meals were made from a combination of staple foods, legumes, roots, tubers, vegetables, and fruits from the six food groups commonly found in Malawi. The schools that received support are in 11 districts, including Chikwawa, Dedza, Kasungu, Mangochi, Mzimba, Nkhatabay, Nsanje, Phalombe, Rumphi, Salima, and Zomba. In addition, 15,448 learners (8,438 girls and 7,010 boys) from 140 ECD centres in seven districts benefited from similar nutritious meals. ÔªøIn total, 24,405 smallholder farmers, organised in farmer groups, supplied food commodities to the schools, helping to create a stable market for their produce and improving the local economy. Additionally, 44,951 small holder farmers benefitted from the homegrown school feeding programme through various interventions including trainings on agricultural practices, including post-harvest loss mitigation and crop diversification. In 2024, WFP continued supporting the government in implementing nutrition-related activities in line with policy, strategic and operational guidance. Key achievements included assisting in finalising the National Multisectoral Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan; supporting the review of critical policy tools such as the National Nutrition Strategic Plan and Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines, adapting them to the 2023 WHO guidelines for managing child wasting and oedema; supporting nutrition evidence generation by providing technical and financial support to the Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) survey and Food and Nutrition security assessment for people living with HIV and tuberculosis (PLHIV/TB) to assess the nutrition situation of the various nutrition vulnerable groups following recurrent shocks particularly the 2024 El Ni√±o-induced drought, which worsened food insecurity and malnutrition.  In response to rising global acute malnutrition (from 2.2% in 2020 to 4.4% in 2024), WFP resumed its supplementary feeding programme in four priority districts of Machinga, Chikwawa, Nsanje and Blantyre, targeting children aged 6 to 59 months. Of the 23,000 children targeted from September 2024 to May 2025, over 11,000 were reached across 107 health facilities, with a cure rate of 84%, surpassing the 75% SPHERE standard. Additionally, with 46% food insecurity and 26% malnutrition among this group, WFP implemented an integrated Nutrition and HIV project in Chikwawa district, benefiting 2,400 individuals in 16 HIV support groups. This initiative provided training in nutrition, financial literacy, and livelihood skills and distributed agricultural resources to improve food security and livelihoods. Among the beneficiaries, 84% showed improved nutrition behaviours and knowledge in diet diversification, finance, and livestock management.  At the subnational level, WFP supported malnutrition prevention activities in Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe, and Zomba districts. District councils and partners conducted 348 care group visits, disseminating essential nutrition information, reaching 38,447 households (76,894 people, 66% women). Through mass awareness campaigns and radio broadcasts, over 740,000 people (58% women) received nutrition social behaviour change messages. Beneficiaries also received assets to support dietary diversification and sanitation improvements. WFP supported district councils by enhancing facility- and community-level nutrition programming through regular coordination and review meetings.  ",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Amidst rising needs, funding constraints persisted in the refugee response, with 75 percent of the required funding received against the annual needs-based plan requirement, marking a slight improvement from the 71 percent funding levels in 2023.WFP | With these resources, WFP reached more than 1.39 million settlement-based refugees (56 percent females) with food assistance, a 2 percent increase from last year's 1.36 million refugees. Of those assisted, 27 percent received 33,739 mts of in-kind food assistance, and 73 percent were assisted through Cash Based Transfers (CBT) valued at USD 43.1 million.WFP | WFP continued to provide food assistance based on vulnerability to food insecurity. The most vulnerable refugees (Category 1), including new arrivals, received a 60 percent ration, while the moderately vulnerable refugees (Category 2), making up 82 percent of the population, received a 30 percent ration. The least vulnerable refugees (Category 3), comprising 4 percent of the population, no longer received food assistance, ensuring that resources were directed where they were most needed. WFP | Cash-based Transfers Scale-up and Digitization.WFP | To enhance operational efficiency, accountability, and empower refugees with control and flexibility to prioritize resources while boosting local markets, WFP continued to scale up CBT in its refugee response. By the end of 2024, 73 percent of refugee beneficiaries received assistance through CBT, an increase from 61 percent in 2023. CBT was delivered using three delivery mechanisms: cash in hand, mobile money, and agency banking. Of the 1,018,961 CBT beneficiaries, 132,003 (13 percent) received their assistance through mobile money.However, the refugee response was influenced by the confirmation of in-kind contributions during the second half of the year, which required adjustments to the programme. WFP received a larger proportion of resources as in-kind contributions, which meant that the initially planned scale-up of CBT to 81 percent by December 2024 could not be achieved as anticipated. WFP | Empowering refugees through Financial and Digital LiteracyWFP promoted digital and financial literacy education among refugees receiving CBT, aligning its efforts with government initiatives such as the Parish Development Model (PDM). WFP adopted the national financial literacy curriculum to support and strengthen government systems and trained 85,624 refugees (52 percent Female) transitioning from in-kind assistance to CBT across 12 refugee settlements. The training equipped refugees with knowledge and skills in managing their finances enhance their financial resilience and explore savings and investment opportunities. Impact stories indicated that trained refugees have initiated income-generating activities like poultry and retail shops significantly improved livelihoods.The use of CBT complemented by digital and financial literacy training has advanced refugees' financial inclusion, contributing to the development of a financial sector ecosystem that enables last-mile access to essential financial services and products. ""From financial literacy training, I learnt that setting savings goals and saving with a purpose will help me avoid unnecessary expenditure and increase my savings in the group. I used my profits to expand into a bar business, and my operating capital now stands at USD 820.""says Butare a financial literacy education beneficiary in Nakivale refugee settlement. WFP | Nutrition AssistanceWFP provided targeted nutrition assistance to prevent and manage acute malnutrition (AMN) among refugees and host communities. A total of 28,805 children and pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls (PBWGs) (90 percent planned) were reached in the management of AMN. Additionally, 250,535 children and PBWGs were reached (92 percent planned) under prevention through the Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition program (MCHN), helping to safeguard their nutritional well-being. In 2024, the proportion of all refugee children (under 5) meeting Minimum Acceptable Diet increased from 9.3 percent in 2023 to 20 percent in 2024 and dietary diversity for women improved from 17 to 19 percent. WFP | Assistance to Crisis- Affected Populations in KaramojaThe food security situation in Karamoja deteriorated in 2024 primarily due to climatic hazards leading to low levels of food production and 45 percent of the population facing high levels of food insecurity (IPC 3 plus). In response, WFP launched an early action response in May 2024 at the start of the lean season to support vulnerable households and protect children under-five, and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers from AMN. To this end, WFP provided cash assistance worth USD 339,241 to 4,275 households across three districts (Kotido, Nabilatuk, and Abim), enabling them to purchase food and seeds for fast-maturing vegetables.Additionally, WFP provided relief assistance to residents affected by severe floods and mudslides in Ntoroko and Kasese districts. A one-time CBT and hybrid (CBT and in-kind) assistance was extended to 17,125 and 5,385 individuals, respectively, who faced food insecurity due to displacement caused by floods and mudslides. In total, 200 mts of in-kind food and CBT worth USD 647,326.40 were distributed to the affected households.",138662738.0,117184922.17,95656136.68,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

This represents more than a threefold increase compared to last year (rising from 3,630 households to 11,424. The increase is attributed to the enrolment of new beneficiaries under the SRM in five refugee settlements.WFP | Various livelihood assets were established, rehabilitated, or maintained in Refugee Hosting Districts and the semi-arid Karamoja region. A total of 37 fishponds were established and stocked with 58,500 fish fingerlings enabling beneficiaries to improve their diets with 15.3 percent of women of reproductive age reporting consumption of more than five food across Karamoja. Additionally, 206 households engaged in fish farming generating approximately USD 10,300 as income from fish sales which supported other needs. The initial investment cost was USD25,514.WFP | Over 1,480 beehives were maintained while a honey mini value chain analysis of Karamoja honey production revealed that on average, participating households sold 20 liters (each liter sold at USD 26), generating USD 520 per household. The income supplemented household food needs.WFP | In Karamoja, beneficiaries expanded vegetable production on over 50 acres, while in the Southwest, beneficiaries trained used own resources to sustain vegetable farming using irrigation systems established three years ago. In Kyaka II settlement, beneficiaries continued investing in livelihood enterprises at the incubation hub, sustaining vegetable production, introducing piggery and fishponds, and identifying markets for their products. These practices were replicated at the household level, boosting vegetable and fish production. The establishment of irrigation systems enabled year-round production with improved productivity, supported by training in agronomic practices.WFP | In Karamoja, 4,140 beneficiaries (828 households) participated in Labour-Intensive Public Works, receiving USD 49,500 in cash assistance for their labour in expanding vegetable production, enhancing household food security and nutrition. In Karamoja, 80% of surveyed households reported benefiting from an enhanced livelihood asset base.WFP | To support production and consumption, WFP rehabilitated water facilities. Through a water assessment done by District Local Government and Ministry of Water and Environment, WFP repaired 45 hand pumped boreholes. Some of these boreholes were around schools, ""We feel relived having water in school because learners no longer move out to fetch water. Instead, we now have members from the nearby communities coming to fetch water from our borehole,"" says Kizito Aleper a teacher at Daniel Comboni Secondary School in Karamoja.WFP | Working with the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), WFP installed five automatic weather stations to enhance preparedness and response to address recurrent floods and mudslides in Kisoro, Ntoroko and Kasese districts, which have impacted livelihoods and increased food insecurity and malnutrition over the past three years.WFP | The Self Reliance ModelThe SRM aims to transition refugees from dependence on humanitarian aid to self-sustenance by building capacities and supporting market-oriented livelihood enterprises. In 2024, the SRM enrolled a first cohort of 7,372 refugees and 3,160 host communities in Nakivale, Oruchinga (Southwest), Rhino, Bidi Bidi and Lobule settlements (West Nile). WFP supported the Government in developing a self-reliance measurement framework which is now the benchmark for partners to assess the impact of their efforts in enhancing refugee livelihoods, resilience, and self-reliance. The tool was officially launched and rolled out across all 13 refugee settlements in Uganda by the Government, agencies, and development partners.Through the SRM, participants received social empowerment through coaching, mentorship, and community participatory planning. Half of the participants engaged in on-farm activities, benefiting from inputs, tools, and training in agronomic practices and animal husbandry. Together, they cultivated 3,718 acres of land, producing various crops at both household and group levels. Another 41 percent of the participants turned to off-farm activities, receiving training and support in business planning. The remaining 9 percent opted for non-farm livelihoods, enrolling in vocational training programs. The latter group was supported with startup grants of USD 550, enabling them to establish small-scale enterprises and contribute to local economies.The SRM also included Nutricash support, enrolling 2,000 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers who received USD 13 monthly to enhance their nutritional well-being. Additionally, 500 refugee aged 80 and above were provided with USD 6.80 monthly mirroring a government-led initiative and testing its scalability to the refugee population.WFP | School Based ProgrammesWFP continued to work closely with the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES), District Local Governments (DLGs), and local communities to support the school feeding programme in Karamoja sub-region. The MoES provided technical leadership at national and sub-national levels, while local government education staff worked with WFP to ensure smooth operations in all supported schools. By end of 2024, the program had expanded to 320 schools (compared to 315 in 2023), including primary, secondary, and vocational schools. However, Karamoja continues to face significant challenges, with literacy rates at just 25 percent compared to the national average of 74 percent. Compounding vulnerabilities and persistent food insecurity is forcing many families to prioritize household responsibilities over education, particularly for girls. This has led to irregular attendance, high dropout rates, and poor academic performance.WFP provided hot meals to 255,000 learners (47percent female) across the 320 supported schools, an 18 percent increase from the 216,000 learners reached in 2023. Despite this progress, funding shortfalls led to maintaining ration size at 80 percent. Nevertheless, enrolment in WFP-assisted schools rose by 16 percent compared to 2023, with female enrolment increasing by 17 percent and male enrolment by 16 percent.WFP | To enhance nutrition and dietary diversity, WFP, working with the International Potato Centre and the National Agricultural Research Organization, promoted the integration of Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potatoes (OFSP) into school meals. In 2024, WFP supported 140 schools, up from 99 in 2023, with 83 actively planting OFSP. The initiative improved food security, nutrition, and incomes, as parents received OFSP vines to grow at home, generating income and boosting livelihoods. This also helped offset school ration cuts. Additionally, WFP worked with the government to develop a standardized School Feeding Menu, ensuring balanced, sustainable, and locally sourced meals that align with national nutrition goals and strengthen food systems.To promote clean cooking and improve fuel efficiency, WFP piloted energy-saving cooking stoves in 65 schools under the school meals programme in Karamoja. Under this initiative, WFP refurbished 55 kitchens, installed 65 institutional improved cookstoves, trained 300 school cooks, distributed 259 household improved cook stoves and supported establishment of 10 local energy access entrepreneurs. Preliminary data shows that the improved stoves have reduced wood consumption and cooking time by half. ""Every month the school has been spending USD 80 on purchasing firewood and this is a huge expense,"" says Agnes Acayo, the Headteacher Looro Primary School. ""With energy efficient kitchens, this monthly cost of firewood has reduced to about USD 27"".To ensure transparency and accountability at the school level, WFP provided tablets to 315 supported schools. Therefore, schools can accurately track meal distribution, monitor nutritional standards, and prevent misuse of resources.To support the development of a national school feeding policy, WFP worked with MoES to conduct and finalize regional consultations across the country. Advocacy efforts led by WFP resulted in Uganda joining the School Meals Coalition, underscoring the government‚Äôs dedication to sustainable school feeding. This milestone also led to the formation of a multisectoral national working group to strengthen coordination at the national level. The membership of the Government to the School meals Coalition has raised the profile of Uganda‚Äôs school feeding programme. The Government of Uganda announced its commitment to contribute resources to school feeding under the Universal Primary Education Programme. This demonstrates Government‚Äôs recognition of school feeding as a critical investment in the health, education, and future of Uganda‚Äôs children.",10115441.0,8260421.32,6940493.27,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

A key milestone was the launch of the National Social Protection Strategy (2024-2029). WFP also facilitated a Regulatory Impact Assessment in preparation for the policy review set for 2025/26. WFP contributed to the creation of essential social protection instruments, including the Shock Responsive Social Protection Framework, the Social Protection Communications and Advocacy Strategy, the Complaints and Grievance Management Guidelines, and a feasibility report for the National Social Registry under the World Bank-funded Fourth Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF4) Project.WFP designed the NutriCash Management Information System (MIS) within government infrastructure that will host data for all nutrition sensitive Social Protection interventions, decentralizing the SAGE MIS to support on demand registration and exit of older persons, and expanding the National Single Registry, which now holds data on 2.6 million beneficiaries and 4.4 million applicants across ten programs.Advocacy efforts undertaken jointly with the Uganda Parliamentary Forum on Social Protection successfully secured increased funding for the Senior Citizens‚Äô Grant and reversed proposed 20 percent budget cuts for 2024/2025 as well as reduction of eligibility age for Older Persons with Disability from 80+ years to 75 years and above thus enhancing inclusivity and expanding the fiscal space for social protection.To build technical capacities on Social Protection (SP), WFP conducted 26 training initiatives for 374 government officials and 13,727 program participants. These efforts were complemented through learning visit to Kenya and Pakistan as part of WFP‚Äôs efforts to strengthen systems and south-to-south learning. The visit aimed to exchange knowledge, experiences, and lessons on the Benazir Income Support Programme and the National Database and Registration Authority. Insights gained from this visit will contribute to the development of Uganda's Dynamic Social Registry to enhance effective targeting and programme coordination. WFP | Nutrition-sensitive Social Protection ProgrammesWorking with the Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social Development (MGLSD), the OPM, and DLGs, WFP reinforced the implementation of the NutriCash intervention across eight refugee-hosting districts in West Nile. This was aimed at supporting the nutrition needs of mothers and children within the first 1,000 days of life through a package of monthly cash transfers, SBCC messages, Financial Literacy and Backyard Gardening (BYG). WFP disbursed USD 1.4 million in monthly CBT to 13,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two, marking a 36 percent decline from 2023, when USD 2.2 million was distributed to 13,600 beneficiaries. The reduction was due to the exit of over 3,000 beneficiaries cumulatively from the CBT component as their babies made two years thus cupping the 1,000-day window. Despite this decline, 90 percent of recipients used the funds to purchase food, underscoring the intervention's critical role in improving household nutrition amidst resource limitations.WFP complemented CBT with SBCC where 13,301 programme participants and their spouses received training in care practices, while 15,102 benefited from financial literacy training. The initiative also established 48 regenerative backyard gardens to promote soil and water conservation, addressing drought challenges. Monitoring reports showed significant improvement in the Minimum Dietary Diversity Score for Women (MDD-W) from 28 percent to 38 percent and the percentage of children meeting minimum dietary diversity rose from 4 percent to 12 percent between 2023 and 2024.WFP expanded the NutriCash program to 3,500 beneficiaries in Karamoja and the Southwest under the resilience and SRM and is supporting its integration into the NUSAF-4 Project. WFP and MGLSD are piloting the Social Cash Transfer for Elderly Refugees, targeting 500 refugees to demonstrate the benefit of integrating refugees in national social protection programs.WFP supported targeted micro-projects across eight districts, tackling teenage pregnancy and child marriage, aligned to the national strategy. As a result, 1,444 teenage parents (96 percent female) were enrolled into 14 government-aided Vocational Training Institutions, coupled with the provision of startup kits to help further support their transition to self-reliance. These were dully graduated in December 2024 with commitment from the DLGs to link them to Government Programmes such as Generating Growth Opportunities and Productivity for Women Entrepreneurs, Parish Development Model and upcoming NUSAF4.Additionally, WFP invested USD 198,000 to bolster systems strengthening with the MGLSD using the Harmonized Approaches for Cash Transfers. This was focused on enhancing social protection data management and reporting systems, capacity building, cash transfer delivery and harmonizing complaints and Grievance redress mechanisms for effective implementation of social protection programs.",8915173.0,7459813.14,5466682.33,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Achievements: The food security sector continues to contribute to Strategic Development Goal 2.1 by improving access to nutritious food among refugees and asylum seekers in the 13 refugee settlements in Uganda. Furthermore, the sector promotes the self-reliance of refugee communities through complimentary activities. The partners reached 1.39 million beneficiaries through the provision of in-kind food as well as cash-based transfers by the end of Q2. However, owing to the prioritization exercise conducted in July 2023, there was a reduction of 14% of beneficiaries who received in-kind assistance and 6% reduction in cash assistance. Additionally, the further reduction in in-kind rations in most refugee settlements due to limitations in funding increased cash enrolments since beneficiaries preferred cash to the reduced rations. Overall, the proportion of beneficiaries who received cash assistance increased from 60% to 63% from Q1 to Q4. 
Digital cash transfer mechanisms through agent banking continued to be scaled up, and cash beneficiaries owning bank accounts increased from 36 percent to 41 percent out of the overall total cash beneficiaries by the end of the year. To increase access to digital payment instruments, Mobile money will start in Kyangwali and Kiryandogo settlements. In addition to increasing access to digital payment instruments through agency banking, cash beneficiaries received financial literacy skills. A total of 2,954 beneficiaries were trained during the reporting period across all 13 settlements. Efforts to mitigate malnutrition continue to be strengthened through building the capacity of health workers, Village Health Teams (VHTs), and other community structures in providing Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) knowledge to promote better household nutrition. Similarly, active case findings have supported in managing the nutrition situation in the settlements. Currently, the recovery rate remains above the threshold with an average of 93% discharged as cured from the programme within the reporting period.

A total of USD 311,620 was distributed, with each household receiving a one‚Äëtime transfer of USD 62.20 (approximately UGX 238,390). Results from a monitoring study indicated that over 90 percent of beneficiaries accessed better quality meals, 52 percent consumed larger portions of meals, and 44 percent invested some of the cash in income generating activities. The UN supported the government of Uganda to respond to a worse drought in three years in Karamoja and provided food assistance to 1.36 million refugees in 2022. Coupled with refugee influxes, the government and UNICEF prioritized protecting and saving lives of children affected by malnutrition, which rose to critical levels in some districts.The 2022 Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) conducted with support from the UN classified all nine districts of Karamoja as Phase III (Crisis). Furthermore, the Food Security and Nutrition Assessment (FSNA) supported by the UN found a significant increase in GAM rates in 2022 over those recorded during the 2021 period. The UN supported Ministry of Health to develop the National Emergency Health and Nutrition Response plan for Karamoja and surrounding districts as well as the ME framework for nutrition response. Further support was provided to conduct a Health and Nutrition Service Assessment in 150 health facilities in 19 districts.The UN provided food and nutrition assistance was extended to 217,747 pregnant and lactating women and children. In addition, a total of 1,839 MT of specialized nutritious food was distributed to 15,591 beneficiaries. The UN supported the life-saving treatment services to 76,938 children, including the estimated 23,000 severe malnourished children in Karamoja and refugee children, and supported infants affected by Ebola. Protective food assistance worth USD188,756 was distributed to 30,548 households through in- kind and cash-based transfers. Furthermore 3,629MT of food was distributed to Karamoja through the Office of the Prime Minister as part of its emergency response in Karamoja. The food assistance represented a 17 percent increase in support in 2022 compared to those in 2021.The UN further provided two doses of 3,702,620 Vitamin A doses vitamin to 3,829,708 of children 6-59 months through the health system. As part of its support to community nutrition, 1,352,763 caregivers were reached with IYCF counselling services during ANC in 29 districts. The UN supported the roll out of the national nutrition platform. The UN supported the OPM to develop a comprehensive multi-sectoral workplan, together with 10 Ministries Agencies and Departments to strengthen nutrition governance and decision making through the National Nutrition Information Platform that was launched and roll out by the Prime Minister. The support enabled the UN to advocate for nutrition and children‚Äôs issues in the national food system transformation agenda for Uganda. Support enabled government to develop nutrition governance and ME framework. This strengthened the functionality of nutrition coordination mechanisms across the different coordination structures at both national and district levels.The UN in collaboration with nutrition implementing partners and district local governments, the UN supported implementation of community-based supplementary feeding Programmes in Karamoja in 126 health facilities and through 253 outreaches/outposts treating 63,374 children moderately acute malnourished reaching out to 30,966 pregnant and lactating women. Over 4.9 million people were reached and delivered key nutrition messages through different platforms like U-report and targeted radio campaigns during the World Breastfeeding Week alone. These efforts strengthened community mass screening, increased family led MUAC outreaches especially in Karamoja and refugee settlements with over 2,538 mothers reached with nutrition related services.The school feeding programme with the MOES and Karamoja district local governments with support from the UN provided 5,806 MT of food for one hot meals to 205,903 learners (97,793 females, 108,110 males) in 315 schools in all districts of Karamoja.The UN supported capacity building efforts on IMAM, basic skills in gender and integration of IMAM and nutrition programming to health workers to improve gender responsive and sensitive nutrition programming, improve nutrition screening and counselling, improve quality of education and real time data in support to education management system and digitization of data collection tools. This contributed to improved household access and nutritious food. This bolstered community capacity to cope with shocks in three regions of West Nile, Southwest and Karamoja and among nationals and refugee populations.Support provided enabled the rollout and implementation of maternal infant young child and adolescent nutrition (MIYCAN) strategy to prevent malnutrition, promoted and protected child and maternal optimal feeding practices through behavior change. Further support was provided in the implementation of anemia control and prevention priority actions, surveillance resulting in the reduction of the anemia prevalence among children in 11 of the 14 refugee locations. The UN support in anemia reduction and prevention priority including testing and treating, supplementation, deworming, and malaria control at both community and facility levels to over 146,000 new arrival person-in-need.The UN supported public health emergency programmes increasing government and health facility readiness and rapid deployment of health workers and 85 nutritionists (47 female) and 165 health workers (91 females), 171 health workers reinforcing TB management and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and gender mainstreaming. In 2022, WFP distributed 73,799 metric tonnes (mt) and USD 42 million to 1.36 million refugees spread across 13 settlements. The Orgnaization also scaled up the use of unrestricted cash transfers to all refugee settlements, reaching 56 percent of the total refugee population receiving general food assistance, with 36 percent of refugees assisted to open bank accounts. This was done in recognition of the benefits and inherent opportunities for both refugees and host communities, such as the multiplier effect of cash. Cash injections created additional economic value by stimulating economic activities, besides other benefits such as increased consumer choice, and digital financial inclusion. WFP partnered with Andre Foods International to implement Community Based Supplementary Feeding Programme in which 91 care groups were established and trained, and 2,203 village health teams received on-job mentorship to extend nutrition and health services at the community and household levels.",214357811.0,182684484.64,158795076.32,"WFP: Assistance to Refugees With available resources, WFP assisted 1.36 million refugees across 13 refugee settlements with in-kind support and CBT. Quality assurance measures were embedded in programme implementation to ensure assistance reached the intended beneficiary households. WFP delivered 39,235 metric tons (MT) of food and USD 41.5 million in CBT. Results from the Refugee Food Security and Nutrition Assessment (FSNA)8 indicated a general deterioration in the food security situation with 68 percent of the targeted households classified as moderately and severely food insecure. This was demonstrated by an increase in the proportion of households reporting poor levels of food consumption from 9 percent in 2022 to 11 percent in 2023. There has also been an increase in the proportion of households employing crisis and emergency coping strategies from 37 percent in 2022 to 40 percent in 2023. In line with nutrition , the dietary diversity score and the minimum dietary diversity decreased. This is attributed to ration cuts which deepened acute food insecurity, increased market prices which affected household purchasing power, and other contributing factors that aggravated the situation such as climatic shocks and hazardsFood Assistance to Crisis-affected people in Uganda WFP provided food assistance to the Ugandan population affected by crisis to address alarming levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in Karamoja sub-region due to severe drought. During the lean season response, food and nutrition assistance was provided between October and December 2023 to address food insecurity, through cash-based 15 2023 | Uganda Annual Country Report transfers, reaching 18,539 people in two hot spot sub-counties of Kaabong and Kotido districts. The response was based on the findings of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis that indicated high Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates above the emergency threshold of 15 percent.9 Additionally, WFP implemented a flood recovery response through a one-off cash assistance provided to 17,667 people in Kisoro district affected by floods and exposed to food insecurity. Efforts such as capacity strengthening, entrepreneurship training, expanding participation as mobile banking agents, and linkages to village savings and loans associations significantly enhanced the ability of refugees, particularly women, to utilize digital and financial services. These initiatives played a crucial role in empowering refugees by providing them with the necessary skills and resources to access and leverage financial services, thereby contributing to their economic independence and self-sufficiency. Similarly, mainstreaming gender responsive SBCC was provided to stimulate positive behaviour change in nutrition practices by engaging men and women to challenge social and cultural norms, stereotypes, and biases. SBCC contributed to male engagement on child and household nutrition. This was demonstrated by 41 father care groups (FCGs) formed.Promoting Digital Financial Inclusion for Refugees WFP promoted digital financial inclusion through enhancing access to digital payment instruments reaching 345,502 beneficiaries across all settlements. Similarly, financial literacy education was promoted, equipping 86,459 (57 percent female and 43 percent male) refugees with knowledge and skills to better manage their own finances. Gender-transformative approaches continued to be integrated into the refugee response to address the barriers that prevent women‚Äôs participation in the economy and enhance women‚Äôs empowerment through financial inclusion and literacy. A total of 49,282 women were trained on financial literacy. This has contributed to increased joint decision-making by women and men within the household on the use of cash transfers. In addition, 47 percent8 of households reported improved spending habits, an increase from 22 percent in 2022. Nutrition Response:To address high levels of acute malnutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women in refugee and host communities, WFP implemented Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF) and Integrated Maternal Child Health and Nutrition (IMCHN) programmes. Due to funding shortfalls, WFP was not able to meet the requirements for specialized nutritious foods (SNFs) for these two activities, forcing WFP to prioritize rations for the TSF programme to ensure that treatment of moderate acute malnutrition was sustained. WFP reached 32,198 women and children with nutrition support to treat acute malnutrition, in the MCHN programme, MCHN rations were reduced by 50 percent reaching 99,768 women and childrenUNHCRAchievements: The food security sector continues to contribute to Strategic Development Goal 2.1 by improving access to nutritious food among refugees and asylum seekers in the 13 refugee settlements in Uganda. Furthermore, the sector promotes the self-reliance of refugee communities through complimentary activities. The partners reached 1.39 million beneficiaries through the provision of in-kind food as well as cash-based transfers. There was a 5% overall increase in cash beneficiaries in Quarter 2, compared to Quarter 1. The increment is attributed to continuous enrolment of beneficiaries from food to cash. Additionally, the further reduction in in-kind rations in most refugee settlements due to limitations in funding increased cash enrolments since beneficiaries preferred cash to the reduced rations. Digital cash transfer mechanisms through agent banking continued to be scaled up, and cash beneficiaries owning bank accounts increased from 36 percent to 41 percent out of the overall total cash beneficiaries by the end of the quarter. In order to increase access to digital payment instruments, Mobile money will start in Kyangwali and Kiryandogo settlements.

UNHCR supported the implementation of nutrition interventions as part of the broader primary health care services at both community and health facility levels and are inclusive of refugee and host communities. Curative interventions largely involved the early identification, referral, treatment, and follow-up of children and women with acute malnutrition using a community network of 2700 village health teams (VHTs). About 31,000 clients were reached with treatment services for acute malnutrition across all refugee settlements, 70% of whom were children below 5 years. Preventive interventions were largely centered on promoting optimal feeding practices of mothers and caregivers, infants, and children through behavior change strategies adapted to both emergency and non-emergency settings. UNHCR supported health facilities to provide complementary services like deworming, vitamin A supplementation, and immunization at the young child clinics and through the bi-annual MoH-led integrated child health days. Nutrition services were offered in refugee settlements, reception centers, and transit centers. UNHCR supported the implementation of nutrition surveillance and surveys to inform performance, resource mobilization, and to determine the situation on key indicators. The July 2023 Food Security and Nutrition Assessment (FSNA) is the main reference point for nutrition survey data needs in the refugee settlements and host districts. UNHCR worked in collaboration with WFP and NGOs to implement nutrition-sensitive food security services like backyard gardening through training, providing inputs, and providing key messages to ultimately improve household dietary diversity. This was done using a network of 769 care groups and 10,766 care group volunteers targeting around 107,660 households across all refugee locations. UNICEFBuilt the capacity of over 285 community development officers in nutrition reporting and provided 285 smart tablets to aid data collection improving electronic monitoring and supervision tools for the social development sectorWith UNICEF support the MoH implemented high-impact interventions including adaptation of the global and regional Maternal Nutrition Action framework and accelerating initiatives on egg consumption. Through these efforts, key maternal nutrition actions have been prioritized, aiming to enhance optimal maternal nutrition, fortify the pathway to ensure the birth of healthy children, and empower the health system to integrate the prevention of child wasting into new-born care services. Vitamin A was provided to 5,023,059 children aged 6-59 months thus contributing to a national coverage of 62.3% in the first semester. A total of 4,240,520 caregivers received IYCF counselling services during ANC services, and 978,592 pregnant women received IFA during their first ANC visit. Furthermore 8,846,353 and 5,323,722 children aged 12-59 months received deworming medication during the first and second semesters, respectively.Empowered communities and caregivers for the early identification of malnutrition, developed tools and disseminated data at all levels. Supported screening of 3,195,275 children through family MUAC to identify and refer cases of severe wasting for treatment. This enabled treatment of 58,252 children aged 6-59 months suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The 3,165 households were also supported through capacity buidling on good agricultural practices to increase their production, post-harvest handling to reduce waste and market linkages for selling of surplus produce for additional income generation. Similarly, in Nakivale, 5,912 refugee households have been supported to access short maturing assorted staple crops and vegetable crops through an electronic value voucher of USD 16, by working with 8 local agro-inputs dealer shops in Nakivale for these households to choose their preferred seeds. The refugee households were provided with capacity building on basic good agricultural practices by the extension service at the district level.WFPWFP assisted 1.36 million refugees across 13 refugee settlements with in-kind support and CBT. Quality assurance measures were embedded in programme implementation to ensure assistance reached the intended beneficiary households. WFP delivered 39,235 metric tons (MT) of food and USD 41.5 million in CBT.To enhance operational efficiencies, WFP scaled up the use of CBT from 57 percent in 2022 to 61 per cent in 2023. This expansion included a 6 percent increase in beneficiaries receiving digital assistance through cash accounts, specifically agency banking and mobile money. A pilot on the use of mobile money was conducted in two refugee settlements (Kyangwali and Kiryandongo) with a total of 4,883 beneficiaries reached.CBT interventions are supported by market intelligence, including the Market Functionality Index (MFI) assessment and price monitoring, which provide a detailed understanding of target markets under all Area Offices. Trader capacity assessments contributed to the evidence base for the mobile money roll-out and are informing the design of retailmarket development activities. WFP continues to collaborate with mobile network operators to address key challenges identified such as low rate of mobile phone ownership, network connectivity, and inter-operability amongst financial service providers.WFP promoted digital financial inclusion through enhancing access to digital payment instruments reaching 345,502 beneficiaries across all settlements.

However, due to funding shortfalls, WFP was not able to meet the requirements for specialized nutritious foods (SNFs) for these two activities, forcing WFP to prioritize rations for the TSF programme to ensure that treatment of moderate acute malnutrition was sustained, reaching 32,198 women and children. The IMCHN rations were reduced by 50 percent reaching 99,768 women and children.A total of 2,314 health workers and village health teams were trained and mentored.During the lean season response, food and nutrition assistance was provided between October and December 2023 to address food insecurity, through cash-based transfers, reaching 17,629 people (39 percent of planned beneficiaries) in two hot spot sub-counties of Kaabong and Kotido districts.Similarly, mainstreaming gender responsive SBCC was provided to stimulate positive behaviour change in nutrition practices by engaging men and women to challenge social and cultural norms,stereotypes, and biases. SBCC contributed to male engagement on child and household nutrition. This was demonstrated by 41 father care groups (FCGs) formed.WFP provided nutritious meals to 216,301 learners (47 percent girls and 53 percent boys) in 315 educational facilities (primary, secondary, and vocational). This is an increase of 5 percentcompared to 2022. School education outcomes indicated an increase in enrolment by 24 percent overall (27 percent for girls and 21 percent for boys) in 2023 compared to 2022 (20 percent). The attendance rate stood at 72 percent (72 percent girls and 72 percent boys).The Home-Grown School Feeding (HGSF) programme (HGSFP) was implemented in 315 schools to provide safe and nutritious school meals purchased from local smallholder farmers. The HGSF links contributed to the agricultural sector by strengthening the capacity of smallholder farmers in agriculture and creating predictable markets through local procurement from schools. Through the continued focus on HGSF, WFP registered a fivefold increase (from 414 in 2022 to 2,345 MTs in 2023) in the local procurement of food from smallholder farmers in Karamoja, which translated to an additional USD 1.9 million injection into the local economy.In addition, the establishment of Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) vine multiplication centres in Karamoja has increased the consumption of sweet potatoes in schools. A total of 80 schools complemented WFP meals with sweet potatoes. This helped mitigate the impact of ration cuts experienced towards the end of the year, as well as contributed to diversification of diets in schools. Furthermore, the establishment of sweet potato gardens promotes agricultural education and sustainability within the school curriculum.To reduce food losses and enhance storage in schools, WFP provided 3,000 silos to more than 200 schools, increasing storage capacity from 357 MT to 1,050 MT. In addition, WFP trained 2,094 individuals on school food management",76361717.66666667,59667340.81,44532634.48,,76361717.66666667,59022529.76,43620513.77,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

In 2022, FAO established 252 and revitalized 22 farmer groups ‚Äì totaling 814 farmer and 20 pastoralist groups currently supported by FAO in the country (Nampula, Zamb√©zia, Sofala and Gaza provinces). FAO also trained 81 farmer facilitators (21 percent women), which in turn trained an additional 477 farmers (32 percent women) in Nampula and Zamb√©zia provinces. The trained facilitators are leading training on their respective groups and are focal points of the farmer group networks. There was a gender imbalance among the farmer facilitators trained due to the fact that community leaders are men, lack of support from husbands for their wives to be absent for five days in a row and the burden of irreplaceable responsibilities of women in their household ‚Äì such as childcare, elderly care, housework and animal care. FAO will continue working to reduce gender imbalances and adjust gender strategies, particularly in the communities. Nevertheless, through FAO support, over 21,000 smallholder producers (approximately 48 percent women) improved capacity on sustainable agriculture in Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala and Gaza provinces. Subjects included (i) good agriculture practices to improve production and productivity of market-oriented crop value chains: maize, rice, pigeon-pea, mung-bean, common-bean, sesame and soybean, (ii) application of climate smart agricultural practices (Polycropping, conservation agriculture, integration of crops and livestock production and agroforestry) for adaptation and mitigation of climate change, raising resilience at farm level and contributing to carbon sequestration; (iii) agroforestry models at farm level to: increase resilience, food and income diversification, biological balance and conservation of natural resources and environmental services (carbon sequestration for carbon credits trade); and (iv) use of integrated cashew management, including the adoption of Good Agriculture Practices (GAP), quality of cashew and renewal of unproductive trees to improve productivity and quality of cashew.Aiming to improve seed systems, FAO supported the establishment of 118 demo-plots by 62 farmers in Nampula and Zambezia provinces. The main objective of these demo-plots was to familiarize producers with the characteristics, productive potential and adaptability of crops to agro-ecological conditions, through engagement with the Agricultural Research Institute of Mozambique (IIAM), seed companies and agro dealers, thereby increasing the demand for quality seeds. To enhance farmers' access to seed markets, 20 extension agents and 20 local seed producers in Nampula and Zambezia provinces were trained on technicalities (good agricultural practices) and quality standards for certified seed production and agribusiness management. FAO facilitated trade in rural areas with (peri)-urban market actors by activating 10 farmer networks and aggregating over 183 farmer groups for commercial purposes. The farmer groups received training in agribusiness management and design based on the Farmer Business School (FBS) Methodology with a focus on enhancing market linkages, negotiation skills and business planning. Furthermore, FAO facilitated trade relations based on inclusive business models and fair-trading practices by organizing a business seminar and providing ad hoc supply chain matchmaking to different actors. The respective farmer groups submitted a total of 80 investment proposals to overcome hurdles in assets related to diversification of activities, facilitate market access or improve production. The matching grants for micro-projects within this FAo intervention ranged in value between 1,500 USD ‚Äì 15,000 USD, which will be funded in 2023.

A comprehensive training package on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) emphasizing on Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) for crop production will entail on/off farm practices that address environmental, economic and social sustainability aspects along the supply chain, which results to safe and quality food and non-food products. This will enable farmers to become resilient to climate shock. Emphasis will also be placed on nutrition-sensitive agriculture to address the double burden of malnutrition in the region._x000D_
_x000D_
The CSA guideline will be used as an instructive tool for informing extension staff and farmers on mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation co-beneficial objectives within agriculture development. More particularly, it will provide guidance on CSA practices and technologies best suited for Kigoma region and the agro-climatic zone. It will also target district development planners and extension agents to plan and budget for agricultural development, and to facilitate community level planning; and extension agents to sensitize, mobilize and train smallholder farmers to adopt agricultural practices considered climate-smart. _x000D_

Additionally, FAO will train smallholder farmers on improved beekeeping practices as an important livelihood strategy for income generating with very high potential for improving income, especially for communities living close to forests and woodlands.  Beekeeping development also has a potential of contributing to self-employment, enhancing agricultural production, promoting and the conservation of the environment._x000D_

WFP is equally committed to empowering both women and men, as well as girls and boys, by providing them with the necessary skills and resources to combat food insecurity effectively.Throughout the reporting year, WFP conducts community sensitization sessions and gender training for cooperating partners and staff. Additionally, WFP translated sensitization messaging into nine languages spoken in the Northeast region. WFP also ensured a balanced representation of women and men in its project management committees, while providing sensitizations and advocacy to community leaders, men and women on the importance of women's participation and decision-making in WFP programming. As a result of these efforts, there was a notable 20% increase in joint decision-making between women and men regarding household resources and involvement in WFP assistance, as reported in the October 2023 Food Security Outcome Monitoring Report. Reports from cooperating partners further indicate a significant rise in women's participation in decision-making within project management committees, underscoring WFP's commitment to enhancing women's involvement at both household and community levels.Despite persistent cultural barriers, which include entrenched gender roles, WFP continues to address these issues diligently and ensure women's meaningful participation in its programmes",50000.0,38327.29,29384.5,"Through community-based structures, there was enhanced participation of women, men, and persons with disabilities in food assistance programs.

As the conflict spreads and deepens, it is expected to affect more people and cause further sporadic displacement and increase needs particularly in northern Ethiopia. As a result of increased displacement, the needs under the Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items (ES/NFI) and Camp Coordination and Camp management (CCCM) sectors in northern Ethiopia are immense. While most internally displaced persons (IDPs) (62% approx.) are seeking shelter with relatives and friends, many of the displaced (77% approx.) are living in crowded locations and sub-standard collective centers.

WFP collaborated with the Government of Angola and other key stakeholders to train 102 technical staff at both central and local levels in food and nutrition security data collection and analysis using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). These trained officials conducted a post-harvest food security and nutrition assessment and analysis in December 2024 aimed at understanding the impact of the El Ni√±o-induced drought. The assessment included a household survey in the most affected rural areas of Benguela, Hu√≠la, Namibe, Cunene, Moxico, and Cuando Cubango provinces. The data collected informed the IPC analysis, which will guide decision-making and support emergency response while also shaping medium- and long-term food security and nutrition policies and programmes. The exercise was supported by the IPC Global Support Unit (IPC GSU), the European Union's Strengthening Resilience, Food Security and Nutrition Programme (FRESAN), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), and other partners. WFP also assisted the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in preparing the final IPC report, which is expected to be published in early 2025.

In response to the El Ni√±o-induced drought, WFP conducted assessment missions with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United States Agency for International Development's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA), and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) to assess the impact on food security, nutrition, and market conditions during the lean season.

WFP further supported the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in revising the Second National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition (ENSAN-II) and the National Council for Food Security and Nutrition (CONSAN). The approval of ENSAN-II is a critical step in ensuring that the strategy addresses the current food security and nutrition challenges comprehensively and is aligned with the National Development Plan (PDN) 2023-2027.

Additionally, WFP trained 23 government staff from Malanje and Cuanza Norte provinces on data collection and monitoring of food and agriculture input prices. This training is part of WFP's capacity strengthening efforts, aimed at improving the capabilities of the Institute of Agrarian Development (IDA) to inform food security trend analysis and the design of future programmes. 

Nutrition and food fortification

WFP continued to support the Ministry of Health in strengthening governance, leadership, and management of the National Nutrition Programme. As part of this effort, WFP trained 92 health facility staff in Lunda Norte and Moxico provinces on managing acute malnutrition, including screening, case finding, treatment, counselling, and stock management. Additionally, WFP co-chaired the nutrition partners working group alongside the Ministry of Health and UNICEF. WFP and UNICEF also supported the adaptation of the Global Action Plan (GAP) on Child Wasting to the Angolan context, providing a framework to accelerate progress in preventing and managing child wasting in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

WFP also played a pivotal role in supporting Angola's membership in the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. The Global Alliance aims to align domestic and international efforts to reduce hunger and poverty through effective programs and policies. The Government also adhered to the 2030 Sprint on maternal and early childhood support. Through this initiative, spearheaded by Brazil's G20 Presidency, the Government of Angola committed to doubling the number of children receiving nutrition support through the maternal and child health improvement and child rights protection and promotion programmes. In 2025, WFP will work with relevant government entities to operationalise these commitments.

Further, WFP worked with the Government of Angola to create an enabling environment for mandatory food fortification, a strategy aiming to address micronutrient deficiencies and improve health outcomes. Recognising the importance of multi-sectoral partnerships, WFP strengthened collaborations with key government entities, United Nations (UN) agencies, and the private sector. WFP was also invited by the Resident Coordinator‚Äôs Office to join an expert panel on enhancing private sector involvement in strategic value chains for food security, nutrition, and fortified food production. This underscores WFP‚Äôs role as a key partner in shaping Angola‚Äôs food fortification agenda. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and UNICEF, WFP facilitated a mission from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Food Fortification Initiative (FFI) to validate the landscape analysis report on food fortification in Angola. The next step will involve finalising the national food fortification strategy and presenting it to the Council of Ministers for validation.

WFP has also provided technical assistance to IDA in implementing the nutrition component of a large-scale project funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The aim was to improve nutrition outcomes by enhancing knowledge on infant and young child nutrition, dietary diversification, food processing, conservation, storage, and water, sanitation, and hygiene practices. WFP, IDA, and IFAD are also exploring opportunities to expand technical assistance in projects aimed at increasing agricultural productivity, reducing post-harvest losses, improving smallholder farmers' market access, and reducing the prevalence of acute malnutrition.

School feeding

WFP remained a key development partner to the Government of Angola, providing policy support, technical assistance, and expertise to enhance the sustainability and scale of the national school feeding programme. In collaboration with an interministerial committee ‚Äîincluding representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Education, Agriculture and Forestry, Health, and Social Affairs, Family and Women's Promotion ‚Äî, WFP supported the redesign of the school feeding programme, which was approved by the Council of Ministers in January 2025. This effort aligns with Angola‚Äôs commitments under the School Meals Coalition to expand access to nutritious meals for all children by 2030.

WFP also advocated for Angola‚Äôs participation in the 2030 Sprint for School Meals, launched as part of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. This would support the scale-up and strengthening of the national school feeding programme through access to a global network of partners.

In 2025, WFP, in collaboration with the Ministries of Education and Planning and the WFP Centre of Excellence Against Hunger, will facilitate a high-level exchange visit to Brazil. Building on successful South-South Cooperation between Angola and Brazil, this visit will showcase Brazil‚Äôs experience in managing its national school feeding programme, with a focus on monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and smallholder market support.",2024-01-01,2028-12-31,Implementation,-,-,WFP,United Nations World Food Programme,Angola Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; World Food Programme Multilateral Fund,Government of Angola,"2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.,2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.,4.2 By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.",2 Zero Hunger; 4 Quality Education,Angola,Convening/Partnerships/Knowledge Sharing; Capacity Development/Technical Assistance; Other (including coordination); Policy Advice and Thought Leadership; Direct Support/ Service Delivery; Data Collection and Analysis,-,-,1 - Contributes to gender equality/women's empowerment in a limited way,,2 - Significant contribution to realization of human rights,"1.4  The Government has strengthened capacity to plan, implement and monitor quality, gender-responsive nutrition programmes and services for the reduction of stunting, prevention and treatment of wasting.; 1.4  The Government has strengthened capacity to plan, implement and monitor quality, gender-responsive nutrition programmes and services for the reduction of stunting, prevention and treatment of wasting.; 1.3  The social protection system is strengthened to address vulnerabilities faced by Angolans across the life cycle and provide income security, particularly for children, women, persons with disabilities, persons in active age who are unable to earn sufficient income and older persons.; 4.5 The Government, including the system for civil protection, and communities have enhanced capacity to prepare for, respond and recover from extreme events.",,-,-,-,Inaara Gulamhussen,,1353066.0,1353066.0,1242964.0,1353066.0,1184010.38,977053.1,-,1353066.0,953774.09,749984.28,-,1353066.0,1063133.48,967772.67,-,1353066.0,1053417.98,871104.27,-,1353066.0,1051494.4,695525.69,-,1353066.0,1152850.74,939616.96,-,1353066.0,1285412.7,1194314.53,-,1353066.0,1045372.25,993103.63,-,1353066.0,933002.35,760667.53,-,1353066.0,1153532.13,995563.44,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

A total of 6.5 tonnes of maize seed, 15 tonnes of harricot bean and 50 tonnes of fertilizer were procured and distributed to 1 000 households in Meiso woreda in Oromia region. Oromia region was prioritized following the severity of the damage caused by desert locusts on the croplands. FAO used this project to conduct a voucher feasibility assessment and to set up a voucher system. Under these activities, FAO recruited technical personnel, identified agro dealers for both crop and livestock inputs, conducted capacity building of selected stakeholders including suppliers and partners and purchased and installed the facial recognition license ‚Äì an essential tool in implementing the system in the future. However, having gone through the assessment phase, the agro dealers never met the additional requirements for engaging on time in the distribution of the assistance package, which forced FAO to directly procure and deliver the inputsto the affected households in order to provide them within the very limited planting window. This method of assistance had cost implications leading to the full utilization of the resourcesfor the project‚Äôs crop production component; the originally-targeted livestock beneficiaries were assisted through a similar FAO project under the overall desert locust programme and where the voucher approach is being successfully implemented. Despite the need to use direct procurement and distribution of livelihoods inputs, the project had a significant positive impact on restoring the productive capacities of assisted households. Through targeted distributions of seeds and fertilizer, 1 000 beneficiary households received 6.5 kg of maize seeds, 15 kgs of vegetable seeds, and a 50 kg bag of fertilizer, which increased their ability to meet their basic food needs through their own production and reduced their reliance on emergency food assistance. Agricultural livelihoods packages were designed in consultation with feedback from beneficiary communities to ensure that the assistance provided was context-appropriate and reflected local needs and priorities. The project also prioritized assisting female-headed households (40 percent of the total beneficiary target), recognizing that these households often face reduced access to agricultural inputs and support services, placing them at greater risk of further food security and livelihoods due to the impact of desert locust upsurge. In total, inputs provided by the project allowed communities in Oromia to produce an estimated 750 metric tonnes of maize and 225 metric tonnes of haricot beans.",1556074.04,1065804.1,987142.01,-,757119.5428571429,591119.0,464925.17,-,757119.5428571429,699087.84,601526.73,-,757119.5428571429,595496.15,424226.24,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Under the tick control programme, acaricides (Amitraz 12.5 percent) were provided for each pastoralist group with an average of 1,060 heads of cattle dipped twice per month. FAO is currently supporting a Newcastle disease vaccination campaign for chickens in 32 villages. In July 2022, approximately 30,000 chickens were vaccinated in 989 households (65 percent women). For this purpose, 36 community vaccinators (36 percent women) in each village were trained and equipped with t-shirts, caps, cooler boxes and a vaccinator notebook. There has been no record of disease outbreaks in all villages covered by the vaccinations since the campaigns began. FAO also supported government-led cattle vaccination campaigns against foot-and-mouth disease, lump skin disease and black leg by providing 40 cooler boxes to transport and store vaccines in two districts of Guij√° and Mabalane provinces and supported the cold chain by providing two fridges and 40 cooler boxes to conserve and transport vaccines for cattle.FAO and WFP conducted two trainings for 24 technicians (seven women) and 541 farmers (399 women) on the use of the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) methodology to support decision-making to prepare and implement the agrarian campaign. As a result, farmer/ pastoralist groups in Mabalane and Guij√° districts in Gaza Province are utilizing the methodology in planning and decision-making processes. In addition, FAO and WFP disseminated information on measures related to the sowing season, use of river and flood-prone areas and determination of crop type. FAO implemented a local seed production programme to establish community seed banks and connect farmers with quality seed aftershocks such as floods or drought. This activity involved 77 farmers (87 percent women) and resulted in the production of 28 tons of certified seed and 15 tons of stored seed that will cover 600 hectares to cope with the next agricultural season. To address constraints on the availability and nutritional quality of pasture during the dry season, FAO improved animal husbandry and feeding for pastoral communities by expanding options for supplementing forage for livestock.

This was possible also through the continued presence of the AA technical focal points who were hired under this initiative at country, regional and global levels . Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic continued to pose challenges, in 2021 priority countries and regions under this project managed to develop, test and calibrate risk monitoring and AA trigger mechanisms for priority hazards, implement AA, advocate for a scale-up of AA, and strengthen coordination and partnerships with key actors. Below are first some global updates, which are followed by selected regional and country-level highlights: - Country-level AA systems: Building upon initial foundations from 2020, most countries now have anticipatory action systems in place, which are currently being tested and calibrated. The systems were developed in close coordination with partners and governments. Priority countries that finalised drought AA systems by 2021 include Ethiopia, Niger, Madagascar, Malawi, the Philippines and Zimbabwe. The frequency, accuracy, timeliness and coverage of risk analyses have improved in several priority countries, although additional efforts are needed to further improve and sustain the relevant capacities and tools. - OCHA AA inter-agency frameworks: In some of the countries prioritized under this project, AA systems were established through inter-agency processes facilitated by OCHA, with substantial technical and operational advice provided by FAO. This was the case of Niger, Chad, Malawi, Ethiopia, South Sudan and the Philippines. Niger and Chad now have a finalised AA framework for drought, Malawi for dry spells, the Philippines for typhoons, while the framework for South Sudan might be established in 2022. - SFERA activations: In 2021, GFFO‚Äôs contribution proved to be highly valuable to protect the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable rural households ahead of forecast shocks. Thanks to the contribution to the SFERA-AA fund, three AA activations could be carried out. When the political crisis started in Myanmar, the distribution of vegetable kits, poultry feed, rice seeds and fertilizers helped boost local food production in rural areas before the arrival of a large number of migrants from towns, thus preventing food security deterioration. In Syria, vulnerable farmers received drought-tolerant wheat seeds and training on climate smart agriculture practices ahead of La Ni√±a-induced dry conditions. The timely anticipatory action intervention allowed farmers to get immediate support to address challenges during the wheat growing season and likely prevented farmers from abandoning their lands. In Madagascar, the forecast outbreak of migratory locusts triggered FAO‚Äôs largest SFERA allocation for AA so far (about USD 1 million) to mitigate crop damages through surveillance ,and control operations ahead of the main agricultural planting season. As a result of the capacity building, timely surveillance and control, a severe deterioration of the locust situation has been prevented. - Capacity building: The first e-learning course on the topic ‚ÄúDeveloping an Anticipatory Action System‚Äù, which was developed under the GFFO initiative last year, was put into practice during several trainings in 2021. In Southern Africa, FAO facilitated an extensive training, for internal staff as well as partner organizations and representatives of governments and regional institutions (e.g. SADC). In Asia, internal training was provided to 11 FAO country offices, and a separate external training was organized for representatives of ASEAN member states. - Normative guidance: The development of guidelines and tools in support of effective anticipatory action programming for the agriculture and food security sectors has progressed in 2021. For example, the review of existing trigger systems and guidelines for drought trigger development has been finalised. Consultations have been conducted with experts in early warning and trigger mechanisms for anticipatory action, as well as experts in community engagement. As a result, the EWEA/AA country toolkit is being revised, and several publications are currently in review/finalization stages, including (1) a review of AA trigger mechanisms for drought; (2) guidelines on establishing triggers for AA; (3) a FAO position paper on AA for slow onset hazards; (4) a note on community engagement in AA; (5) a note on analyzing the effectiveness of AA, among others. Advancements have been also made for linking analytical tools and exploiting complementarities and synergies among them. For instance, country case studies are underway to understand data/information needs to strengthen the linkages between IPC acute food insecurity projections and AA, and to produce concrete recommendations. These activities might also lead to the development of a guidance on the use of IPC projections to trigger AA. - Support institutionalisation of AA: With the support of this initiative with GFFO support, FAO and partners were able to work closely with regional and national decision-makers to support the uptake and institutionalisation of AA. This process is critical to ensure continuous monitoring and sustainability of the AA systems within countries and supports the scale-up of the AA approach. Further work is still required, but some successful examples include the inclusion of the AA concept in the ASEAN AADMER Work Programme 2021-2025, and FAO‚Äôs support to the ‚ÄúASEAN AA Framework in Disaster Management‚Äù in 2021. The Framework aims to harmonize definitions, and encourage the uptake of the approach in the region. It will outline actions on how to move forwards and provide guidance on how to scale up and link the approach to existing gains enhancing disaster management in the region. Similarly, in East Africa IGAD is guiding the development of a roadmap on AA, in close coordination with FAO and other organizations. In Niger technical support was initiated to include AA into the new 2021/25 strategy of the Directorate for Food Crisis Prevention and Management (DNPGCA). - New partnerships and complementary finance: Thanks to the increasing capacities and evidence generation funded by GFFO during recent years, FAO was able to further expand strategic partnerships and the coverage of its AA programme. For example, the pilot programmatic partnership (PPP) between FAO and DG ECHO officially began in August 2021, for a period of 3 years. The theme is scaling up anticipatory action, including through social protection. The target countries for year 1 are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Lao P.D.R., Viet Nam and the Philippines, with a view to further increasing geographical and financial coverage from Year 2. - Events, advocacy and commitments to bring AA to scale: In 2021, anticipatory action was high on the international agenda. It featured prominently in several major global events, such as the G7 Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Crises Compact; the High-Level HumanitarianEvent on Anticipatory Action; the High-Level Brussels Dialogue High-level Brussels Dialogue - From reaction to prevention: anticipatory action against food crises; and COP26, among others. Coordinated advocacy efforts, especially in the framework of the Anticipatory Action Task Force (AATF), helped mobilize commitments to scale-up anticipatory action in the face of unsustainable increases in humanitarian needs and costs. At the High-Level HumanitarianEvent, FAO committed to dedicate up to 20 percent of emergency and resilience financing towards anticipatory action over the next five years, with the help of partners‚Äô contributions. Further relevant events are highlighted in section 9. Furthermore, FAO actively contributed to exchanges of good practices and harmonization of methodologies for Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL) of AA (e.g. through participation in meetings and initiatives of the AA MEAL Practitioners group)",1084937.9949999999,795289.18,684327.59,-,1084937.9949999999,947262.38,692832.65,-,1084937.995,987814.09,816879.36,-,1084937.995,859433.75,619871.57,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

Over the fresh season in 2022 ‚Äì 12,052 farmers (39.5 percent female) also accessed quality inputs (horticulture seeds, tools, fertilizers and herbicides). Additionally, 88 agro-dealers were trained or received refresher training in view of the agriculture season 2022-23. Within the scope of this FAo intervention, in close coordination with TechnoServe, the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), the Nuts Institute of Mozambique (IAM) ‚Äì FAO conducted an e-voucher pilot as a mechanism to facilitate access of 1,490 (22 percent female) farmers to tools and chemicals for cashew tree maintenance in two districts of Nampula Province (Angoche and Mogovolas). FAO activated 10 farmer netwok and activated an additional 20 farmer networks in Nampula and Zambezia provinces - covering in total 508 farmer groups.

As part of the e-voucher pilot for expansion of cashew tree treatment, 3 670 cashew producers redeemed pesticides and farm tools in Meconta, Angoche, Mogovolas districts of Nampula Province. The pilot is implemented in coordination with the government through the Mozambique Institute of Nuts (IAM) and GIZ and Techno Serve (private sector), aiming at gradually reducing the current system of IAM subsidies and to promote the inclusion of the private sector in direct sale and distribution of agrochemicals (agrodealers, spraying service providers and producers). The ultimate goal of this initiative is to improve coverage and sustainability of cashew treatment, which is key to increase the productivity and quality of cashews.Availability of seed at community level increased.Approximately 300 tonnes of seed (maize, rice, groundnut, cowpea, sesame, sorghum, pigeon peas, holoco beans, andoya) were produced by 170 local seed multipliers (in 290 hectares) in 10 in Nampula and Zambezia provinces. The seed was produced following all correct/standard production steps with FAO and Government support. About 91 percent of the farmers commercialized their seed through agro-dealer networks engaged in the FAO e-voucher scheme, while the remaining 9 percent of farmers sold directly to community members. FAO also mobilized, trained and engaged 26 seed multipliers from 3 districts in Sofala province.Farmers' awareness of available seed varieties improved.A total of 111 demonstration plots of seed varieties (maize, rice, sorghum, soybean, sesame, cowpea, common beans, rice and pigeon pea) were established in 10 districts of Nampula and Zambezia provinces and seven field days and seed fairs were held. This improved producers' familiarity with the seed varieties characteristics, productive potential, adaptability to agro-ecological conditions in the various climactic zones, organoleptic qualities, among other aspects. It is to note that FAO promotes climate adapted and high nutrition value varieties.Availability of seed varieties in the country improved.Seven wheat genotypes were selected for Mozambique‚Äôs agro-ecological zones and two of the varieties have been released for registration in the seed varieties system. Additionally, 12 cassava clones were selected as tolerant and/or resistant to Cassava Brown Streak (CBSD) and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and were planted on two hectares in Angoche and Gil√© districts, in Nampula and Zambezia provinces, respectively.Communities improved opportunities for knowledge and experiences sharing.Ten farmer networks, covering a total of 200 farmer groups were initiated for commercial purposes. The networks provide a platform for market aggregation and structuring by clustering independent farmers with relatively low market volumes that are in geographical proximity. As the groups receive capacity training on agribusiness management and design, the establishment of geo-clusters is facilitated, ensuring that the groups organize their farms as businesses, resulting in steady ‚Äì consistent supply of quality production in the volumes required to successfully enter markets. This enhances market access and inclusion in commercially driven off-taker supply chains. Effective geo-clustering is further facilitated and supported through the Agricultural Market Information System (SIMA), which was created with FAO support.",786436.0,584246.02,473442.02,-,88402.0,73949.02,58705.79,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
