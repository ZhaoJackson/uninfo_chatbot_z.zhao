The launch of the platform, which marked the culmination of 5 years of collaborative work, was deployed in police stations in ANB, BRB, GRN, VCT and SKN. Of the 51 combined stations stations across these jurisdictions that have the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the system, 80% have fully onboarded the PRMIS platform and are relying on it for management of crime data. In ANB, 100% of stations had been operationalised by year-end. To support the effective utilisation for the data to make informed crime prevention decisions and to ultimately reduce the number of victims of intentional homicide (SP Outcome 3, Indicator 5), over 1,000 police officers were capacitated to undertake data collection and crime analysis, with more than 50 trained as trainers to support sustainability. This work contributed directly to the UNDP Strategic Plan Signature Solution Indicator 2.3.1.Challenges﻿In some jurisdictions, lack of ICT infrastructure within some police stations prevented the full deployment of the PRMIS system. While an initial assessment of the national capacity to roll-out the platform had been undertaken, it did not fully reflect the status at each individual police station and it was later recognised that some critical elements including internet connectivity remained a challenge and prevented more uptake of the digitalisation programme. As a result, some of the hardware deployed in previous periods was not fully utilised and it was not possible to operationalise PRMIS and in these instances the roll-out was delayed and could not be completed by year-end.","638136","638136","406583","CARISECURE 2.0 (as at June 2023)The budget for 2023 was at the time entered, envisioned to focus on salaries, therefore the expenditure entered also reflects salaries.

With over 190 participants, strong youth participation and presentations on both CS1.0 and CS2.0 including the latest mapping and gap analysis presentations from CS2.0 consultant, the event created a strong partnership opportunity and facilitated a platform for national dialogue on data driven crime policies.  Consultants contracted to provide Mapping and Gap Analyses on youth and TIP, completed their reports during Q2 and this helped focused the projects next steps. Consultants focused on developing youth and TIP multi-year country workplans building on the Mapping and Gap Analyses work, were contracted and began work in Q2 with delivery concluding in Q3. Missions to Grenada and SVG were planned for early Q3 to formalize country workplans.  Consultations with the Media Institute of the Caribbean to support a media assessment on youth and crime and TIP in the project countries, has progressed with contracting due to take place in early Q3 and delivery of assessment and recommendations by end of Q3.  High-level agreement between BB MCO and TT MCO on joint delivery approach of CS2.0 in Trinidad and Tobago has significantly improved relationships and delivery arrangements.

Cela implique l'engagement et la participation de tous les acteurs dans l'enquête sur la corruption et les crimes économiques, y compris l'ULCC (Unité de Lutte Contre la Corruption), l'unité d'enquête de la PNH (Police Nationale d'Haïti) et le Parquet.• LBC/FT : Renforcer les autorités compétentes, avec un accent particulier sur les enquêteurs financiers de la PNH et de l'Unité Centrale de Renseignements Financiers (UCREF), les autorités judiciaires et le secteur privé pour mieux comprendre les risques liés au blanchiment d'argent et au financement du terrorisme, et pour détecter, enquêter et poursuivre les cas de blanchiment d'argent et de financement du terrorisme de manière plus efficace.Le projet a été initié par une mission d'évaluation dirigée par l'ONUDC en collaboration avec l'OEA et facilitée par le BINUH. Cette mission a marqué le début d'un effort global visant à renforcer les mesures de lutte contre la corruption et les enquêtes sur les crimes financiers dans le pays.Dans la phase initiale, l'ONUDC, tirant parti de son vaste expérience du Mécanisme d'Examen de l'Application de la CNUCC et des premiers engagements avec le pouvoir judiciaire et les principaux organes de lutte contre la corruption, a réalisé une évaluation approfondie du système de justice pénale. Cette évaluation a identifié des lacunes spécifiques et des besoins en expertise parmi les juges haïtiens, les procureurs, la police et le personnel des organes spécialisés dans les enquêtes sur la corruption et les finances.En réponse à ces constats, l'ONUDC, en partenariat avec le PNUD, a élaboré un manuel d'introduction à la lutte contre la corruption adapté aux juges et aux officiers de police judiciaire. Ce manuel vise à établir une base de connaissances fondamentale. S'appuyant sur cette initiative, l'ONUDC a commencé à développer des outils plus complets, y compris un programme de formation détaillé sur la lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers, ainsi que des directives sur la conduite éthique et l'intégrité pour les professionnels du droit, mettant en avant leur rôle dans la lutte contre la corruption, qui doivent être finalisés en 2024.De plus, l'ONUDC a lancé l'évaluation des procédures internes de l'ULCC, avec une méthodologie partagée et approuvée par les homologues nationaux. Cette évaluation devrait être achevée en 2024.En outre, l'ONUDC et l'OEA ont fait des progrès significatifs dans la promotion de la coopération internationale pour soutenir les autorités haïtiennes dans leur lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers. Cela inclut la facilitation de l'adhésion à des réseaux internationaux tels que GLOBE et la facilitation de l'établissement de coopérations internationales avec plusieurs États, renforçant ainsi le cadre global et la capacité à aborder ces questions critiques.De plus, l'ONUDC et l'OEA ont avancé stratégiquement le cadre pour soutenir les autorités haïtiennes dans la lutte contre la corruption et les crimes financiers. Cela a impliqué le développement et le déploiement d'outils et de modules de formation ciblés conçus pour améliorer les compétences et les connaissances des principaux acteurs du système judiciaire et des forces de l'ordre haïtiens. Ces efforts ne visent pas seulement à fournir un soutien immédiat, mais aussi à favoriser le renforcement des capacités et le renforcement institutionnel à long terme.","5903631","0","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In 2022, the project held an international conference on prison management and organized crime, sharing knowledge and promoting discussions on the topic to over 300 participants. The initiative also fostered the integration of the prison intelligence network through the organization of two prison intelligence workshops. The project has been supporting the elaboration of national guidelines on classification of prisoners as means to secure effective prisoner management, considering both their needs and the risks involved.The project has promoted cooperation between Brazil and Paraguay through an exchange visit of representatives from the Paraguayan Ministry of Justice to the Brazilian state of Maranhão, to receive expertise on effective prison management. The project also fostered cross-border police cooperation to respond to drug trafficking through a seminar on the topic held in Manaus, involving representatives from the Brazilian Federal Police and the National Polices of Colombia and Peru.https://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/05/unodc-discute-gestao-penitenciaria-e-classificacao-de-presos-em-visita-ao-maranhao.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/06/unodc-promove-conferencia-internacional-sobre-gestao-penitenciaria-em-resposta-ao-crime-organizado.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/07/autoridades-paraguaias-participam-de-visita-de-intercambio-sobre-gestao-penitenciaria-no-brasil.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/12/em-manaus--autoridades-brasileiras--peruanas-e-colombianas-participam-de-misso-de-intercmbio-sobre-cooperao-policial-para-o-enfrentamento-ao-trfico-de-drogas.html","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

At the beginning of the year, UNODC organized the International Exchange on Operations in the riverine domain, at the Center for Integration and Improvement in Environmental Policing (CIAPA), in Brazil, between Brazil, South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania.Regarding the cooperation between Brazil and Paraguay, GMCP held a Bilateral Tactical Training on Riverine Operations and an International Exchange on Tactical and Operational Approaches to Crime in the riverine domain. Both activities aimed to improve the coordination between Brazilian and Paraguayan efforts against riverine crime in the Tri-Border region.The project made significant efforts to promote South-South cooperation between Brazil and West African countries, namely Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, and Senegal. In November, it organized the Inter-institutional Dialogues to foster the exchange of information between intelligence agents from Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, Senegal, and Brazil. In the same month, GMCP held the first phase of the Diving Course for ship hull sweeping. The course aims to train public security agents in basic and advanced diving to enable them to take part in the second phase of the training, which will enable them to carry out public security dives and conduct ship hull scans.

In tandem, GMCP donated public safety diving equipment to the Brazilian Federal Police, to accelerate port inspection of ships headed to export.  Firstly, UNODC offered basic and advanced diving lessons to Brazilian federal police officers and officers from selected West African countries: Senegal, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, and Nigeria, as this is necessary to undergo the specific course on ship hull inspection. Then, this year, the first cohort (06 people) underwent the hull inspection course. The second and third cohorts started the diving training in 2024 and are expected to learn hull inspection in 2025. In 2024, Brazilian divers intercepted half a ton of cocaine in ship hulls at the Santos Port. Investing in South-South Cooperation, UNODC held tripartite meetings to address illicit flows, contraband, and transnational organized crime via river routes: two sessions between Brazil, Paraguay, and Colombia regarding the Paraná-Paraguay Rivers, and two sessions among Brazil, Colombia, and Peru on the Amazon River Basin. In addition, UNODC held two training sessions under the River Operations Exchange Program for public security agents from Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Mozambique in conducting river and riverine operations in the Amazon region, held at the Center for Integration and Improvement in Environmental Police. As a result of the Paraná-Paraguay Rivers talks, UNODC will invest in operational training for river operations to address drug trafficking and illicit flows. In the northern area, the focus was on the exchange of best practices, the practical application of international policies, and the technical review of cooperation memoranda between the countries. Additionally, UNODC held a workshop on multivariate analysis methodologies in Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS), to promote the use of spatial analysis tools to support law enforcement interventions in the fight against organized crime in the triple border region between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.","670000","570000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In Paraguay, one of the activities was a Training of Trainers (ToT) in Prison Matters; by December 2023, these instructors had trained an additional 373 prison officers.PRIS-COOP organized several capacity-building and policy-focused activities. In Brazil, the project promoted seven (07) training sessions in partnership with the National Secretariat of Penal Policies (SENAPPEN). The project focused on strengthening state-level capacities in prison intelligence, training prison unit directors at the state and federal levels on dynamic security and enhancing the capacities of instructors of the National School for Criminal Services of SENAPPEN. In Paraguay, UNODC facilitated the organization of three (03) training sessions in partnership with Brazilian government agencies at the federal and state levels. The first course, in April, was on prison procedures and routines for the students at the Higher Technical Penitentiary Institute (ITSP) of Paraguay; then, in October, PRIS-COOP held a Training of Trainers on the theme. The third activity was aimed at prison unit Directors, to bolster leadership skills.  Additionally, PRIS-COOP supported four (04) international workshops to promote prison cooperation and police cooperation to address transnational organized crime within and outside prison settings. In parallel, UNODC worked to support Brazil and Paraguay in the theme of the classification of prisoners. In Paraguay, PRIS-COOP supported the development of general guidelines and an action plan for the development of a national classification system.In Brazil, UNODC was appointed as an official member of the National Technical Working Group to elaborate a National Standard on the Classification of Prisoners of the National Secretariat of Penitentiary Policies. The group will propose parameters for the implementation and operationalization of classification by the Brazilian states. UNODC was also invited to support the training of personnel on the SENAPPEN-supported pilot project on the classification of prisoners in Rio Grande do Norte, a Brazilian state which suffered a series of attacks against public buildings, businesses, public and private vehicles by prison-based organized groups in early 2023.","600000","463145","435053","Under UNODC’s mandate to safeguard and implement The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules, and in line with the United Nations System Common Position on Incarceration, over 4,100 prisoners underwent classification interviews in three Brazilian states with UNODC support. In Amapá, the entire prison population (3,317 people) was interviewed by nurses, psychologists, and social workers to identify individual needs (https://tinyurl.com/34kmkcz7). Classification is highlighted in both abovementioned documents as imperative in promoting the resocialization of prisoners, guaranteeing prisoners’ rights – especially to access basic services, work, and education – and improving security for prisoners and prison staff alike. After the initial interviews, each state must advance in 2025 in drafting Individualized Sentence Plans that will contain each prisoner’s personal plan in view of access to education, work, health needs, and more. In 2024, in order to promote best practices in humane prison management, UNODC promoted the Workshop ‘Individualizing Sentences: Implementation of the Classification of Prisoners’ and the First International Seminar on Prison Intelligence (https://tinyurl.com/3xu93rmz); overall, 236 people participated in both events in total. Additionally, the office translated the UN System Common Position on Incarceration. In 2024, UNODC trained 778 penal police officers, prison officers, and other law enforcement agents from Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Colombia on prison management – especially prisoner classification, prison intelligence, and operational protocols. 276 Brazilian penal police and other law enforcement officers were trained on prison intelligence topics(https://tinyurl.com/mpn2mtuc, https://tinyurl.com/488883sn).In Paraguay, 260 prison staff were trained in prison procedures and basic intelligence. Finally, six prison officers from Colombia and Peru participated in a training on prison intelligence held in the north of Brazil.","350000","10000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In the scope of research, the project produced two main publications: (a) the “Qualitative Research on HIV Prevention for Women who Use Drugs with beneficiaries of ‘Programa Atitude’ in Recife and Caruaru”, and (b) the “Study on Causalities of Crime and Violence”.The first of the two studies evaluated the qualitative impact of the Programme for Integral Attention to People who Use Drugs and Respective Families (Programa Atitude) on its beneficiaries and issued recommendations for its improvement. The second, in turn, provided theoretical and empirical support for the formulation and design of systems and public policy aimed at social prevention in Pernambuco.Regarding capacity-building, UNODC held two main events: the Week for the Social Prevention of Crime and Violence and the 6th edition of the Youth Ambassadors Training Programme.The Pernambuco Week for the Social Prevention of Crime and Violence, which included a series of concomitant actions to encourage debate, qualification, and the construction of strategies for reducing violence and promoting social development in the State. It included training for municipal managers, a workshop on best practices, citizenship actions, a joint effort for conflict mediation, and the promotion of lecture cycles with the local prevention network.The 6th edition of the Youth Ambassadors Training Programme was held in Recife, in partnership with the Government of Pernambuco. A diverse group of 25 youths were trained to act as multipliers of the 2030 Agenda in their respective communities. They are now part of the National Youth Ambassadors Network, with the role of acting as spokespeople in national and international forums to promote policies for violence prevention, the promotion of peace, the search for fairer societies and sustainable development.One of the newly trained Youth Ambassadors told UNODC that ""The Youth Ambassadors Program connects my restlessness with what I believe in: education and the power of youth. It's incredible to be able to improve my knowledge to help other young people.

In 2023, in the scope of ECOS’ action on forest crimes, UNODC conducted a study on the creation of images and near-infrared spectra databases of 15 key species of native wood in national and international trade and/or listed in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).The database will be used to improve algorithms applied in timber identification, with the goal creating of a tool for use in the field by law enforcement and environmental inspection agents. Such a tool would strengthen the response of these institutions in combatting illegal logging, while also contributing to the construction of more robust evidence for criminal investigations related to environmental crimes.UNODC and the Brazilian Forestry Service plan to launch an application in late 2024 based on the final algorithm. Project ECOS held the Regional Workshop for the Advancement of Timber Identification Field Techniques at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden in November 2023 to present the preliminary results of the research and to strengthen inter-institutional work in the area.In the scope of minerals-related crimes, ECOS also held in Brasilia the 7th Informal Law Enforcement Network Meeting on Minerals-Related Crimes in cooperation with the World Customs Organization, the Government of France, USAID, and the European Union. The meeting connected relevant government officials and non-governmental organizations to strengthen information exchange related to the production and trade of mineral resources, including precious metals and stones.Additionally, the UNODC projects ECOS and Tapajós organized in Brasilia the first International Conference on Mercury Trafficking, in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change. The conference had the objective of discussing emerging trends and challenges related to illicit mercury trafficking and gathered representatives from the Federal Government, security forces, environmental inspection agencies, embassies, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and civil society.Finally, within the fronts of action of wildlife trafficking and illegal fishing, UNODC organized the Indicator Framework Exercise of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in November in Brasília.

The genera, which include famous trees such as Ipê, Cumaru, and Cedro-rosa, are included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  Following a multi-stakeholder diagnosis of Brazilian normative on crimes against wildlife, UNODC launched the ‘Country Report: ICCWC Indicator Framework for Combating Crime against Wildlife’ in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MMA) in 2023. Now, UNODC is supporting IBAMA in drafting the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Combat of Wildlife Crimes in consultation with relevant partners (https://tinyurl.com/mpw5vs3e).  Over 2024, project ECOS trained 119 people. 55 representatives from Brazil and other 10 South American countries were trained in Basic Intelligence for Environmental Surveillance (https://tinyurl.com/zc3wa244), and 21 Brazilians were trained in Shark Finn Identification (https://tinyurl.com/4jv8ud5e). Over 350 people attended the launch of the normative on endangered genera on-site or online during the “Ipê and Cumaru Week” promoted by UNODC and IBAMA. After the launching event, 43 IBAMA professionals were trained on how to apply the new norm. The Statement on Non-Prejudicial Exploitation, the founding part of the regulation, was built with the participation of more than 120 professionals.  UNODC is leading the development of two portable timber identification tools: one based on imaging and another on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); early in the year, both techniques showed promising results in the field (https://tinyurl.com/9x6vmcds).

AIRCOP is a  multi agency project based on the cooperation between  UNODC,  INTERPOL and  the World Customs Organisations (WCO) that aims at  strengthening the capacities of participating  international airports in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East to  detect and intercept drugs, other illicit goods (including firearms, their parts and ammunition) and high-risk passengers (including victims of trafficking in persons and foreign terrorist fighters) in origin, transit and destination countries with the overall objective of  disrupting the illegal criminal networks. 
The increased capacity and knowledge of trained personnel has led to the expansion of the project scope to cover the multiple  threats targeting airports, including all illicit drugs, illicit goods (such as wildlife, counterfeit medicines or weapons) and, as of late, terrorism and trafficking in persons.
In 2022, UNODC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for the implementation of the AIRCOP Programme at the Piarco International Airport in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. To date, 8 vetted officers from the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS), the Immigration Department, the Customs Agency have been assigned to form the AIRCOP Task Force.
AIRCOP provides a range of standard and specialized training and mentoring activities, tailored tonational and regional needs. Topics covered include intelligence collection and sharing, targeting, search techniques, counterfeit documents, behavioral analysis, use ofl aw enforcement databases, secure communication procedures and post-seizure investigations, as well as specific thematic issues.
In 2022, UNODC facilitated training for the AIRCOP Task Force in the following areas:
-	AIRCOP Introductory Training
-	AIRCOP Training on Integrity in Law Enforcement
-	AIRCOP Training on Gender and Human Rights in Law Enforcement
-	Specialized Training on the Safe Handling of Synthetic Opiods, use of Raman Drug Testing Devices and Drug Precursor Kits
-	Specialized Training on Intelligence and Data (API and Passenger data)
-	Specialized Training on the Use of the WCO CENComm Platform
-	Exchange of Best Practices amongst AIRCOP JAITFs in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
Likewise, retrofitting and equipping of the AIRCOP working room was also carried out in 2022. One Raman Drug Testing Device was delivered to the AIRCOP Team for the Identification and Detection of Illicit Substances.
