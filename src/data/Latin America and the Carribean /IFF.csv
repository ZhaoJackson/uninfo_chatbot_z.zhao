Au Segment de haut niveau sur l’apatridie tenu à Genève en octobre 2019, le Gouvernement a pris les trois engagements suivants : (1) simplifier et améliorer l’accès à l’enregistrement des naissances dans les zones rurales et d’accès difficile ; (2) poursuivre la réforme de l’état civil lancée en 2005 ; et (3) harmoniser la législation sur la nationalité. En novembre 2019, le Gouvernement a aussi publié un arrêté accordant un délai de 5 ans aux personnes non enregistrées pour régulariser leur état civil. 
Dans ce contexte et suite au tremblement de terre du 14 aout 2021 ayant ravagé la région Sud du pays, le HCR s’est engagé à appuyer les institutions nationales de l’état civil à répondre au sérieux problème de documentation civile auquel la population de cette région est confrontée. Sur la base des consultations avec le ministère de la Justice et de la Sécurité Publique et la Direction des Archives Nationales d’Haiti (ANH), et d’une évaluation des besoins menée par l’Initiative Citoyenne pour les Droits de l’Homme (ICDH) en 2022, le besoin d’appuyer les bureaux d’état civil dans le département des Nippes a été identifié.
Ce projet, mis en œuvre par le HCR en partenariat avec le partenaire local ICDH, est conçu en vue d’appuyer le Gouvernement haïtien, dans la concrétisation des engagements pris au Segment de haut niveau sur l’apatridie et en lien avec la Campagne Globale du HCR pour mettre fin à l’apatridie et le Plan d’Action du Brésil. Cette initiative fait suite à un projet du même genre qui a été mis en œuvre en 2022. La population cible inclut les groupes suivants : (i) Les Haïtiens ou personnes d’origine haïtienne déportées d’un pays tiers vers Haiti en 2021 et en 2022 à risque d’apatridie ; (ii) les personnes déplacées internes qui ont perdu leur document d’état civil pendant le tremblement de terre du 14 aout 2021 et les autres aléas naturels qui ont affecté le département au cours des années antérieures, et (iii) les personnes non enregistrées et les nouveaux nés.
Les activités suivantes ont été mises en œuvre : 
a)      Renforcement de capacité de la contrepartie nationale et des acteurs de la société civile sur les questions liées à l’état civil, la législation nationale et les procédures d’enregistrement de naissance.b)      Activités de sensibilisation sur l’importance de la documentation civile et l’enregistrement des naissances c)      Appui aux bureaux d’état civil dans l’enregistrement des naissances à travers la fourniture d’équipements, de mobiliers et la mise à disposition de matériels d’enregistrement tels que les formulaires d’enregistrement de naissance et les registres.d)      Réalisation de campagnes mobiles d’enregistrement de naissances dans les zones rurales éloignées et d’accès difficile.e)      Appui au processus de numérisation des actes d’état civil par la donation d’équipements informatiques à la Direction des Archives Nationales d’Haiti (ANH).

Additionally, 12 civil society organizations (CSOs) participated in an information-sharing session that allowed for an overview of the support services available to vulnerable and marginalized populations, the processes used in collecting data from women who use these services and how data is managed, analyzed, and utilized in programme planning and improvement. The “National Study on the Economic Costs of Violence Against Women and Girls in Jamaica” was undertaken in recognition of the fact that violence imposes costs on individuals (i.e., victims and their families) as well as the country. The study, which was well received by the Government of Jamaica, estimates the cost of VAWG and aids in understanding the severity of the costs and the impacts on the national income so that appropriate investments can be made to lessen, if not eradicate, the incidence of VAWG. The report also establishes a comprehensive economic costing model for Jamaica to estimate the cost of VAWG using country-level data and parameters.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
