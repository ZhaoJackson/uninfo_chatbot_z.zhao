It is a partnership between UNODC, UNDP, and the National Secretariat for Drugs and Asset Management of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security (SENAD/MJSP) of Brazil.During the year, UNODC and SENAD reformulated the Center of Excellence for Illicit Drug Supply Reduction into the Center for Studies on Drugs and Socio-Community Development (CDESC). The center’s scope of action was expanded to include demand reduction and innovative action (e.g., alternative development), to support evidence-based public policy. While maintaining the role of a center of research on illicit drugs, it will focus on innovation, care, treatment, prevention, human rights, alternative development, inclusion, and community-based interventions.In 2023, CoE/CDESC produced a series of publications, namely:The chapter on Amazon of the UNODC’s World Drug Report 2023.The Fourth Report of the Brazilian Early Warning Subsystem on Drugs in Brazil – “Fentanyl: characterization and presence in Brazil.”The Fifth Report of the Brazilian Early Warning Subsystem on Drugs in Brazil – “Synthetic cannabinoids: data on supply, demand and challenges in Brazil.”The study “Dynamics of the illicit drug market in Brazil (Vol. 2): Degree of purity of cocaine in four states.”, andThe publication “Drug trafficking in the Amazon region: initial findings.”The chapter on Amazon of the UNODC World Drug Report (WDR 2023) was important to bring forth the theme of the nexus between drugs and crimes that affect the environment and convergent crimes in the region, especially narco-deforestation and “narcogarimpo”, or narco-mining. The WDR brief on the Amazon was featured by Brazilian media, including “Jornal Nacional” and “Estadão”.The publication “Drug trafficking in the Amazon region: initial findings” focuses on the Brazilian Amazon and, beyond providing initial information on the subject, tries to identify future research possibilities. It was an important instrument to later inform the creation of an alternative development agenda in the region.Finally, the reports of the Brazilian Early Warning Subsystem on Drugs were important to map the rise of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) in Brazil and its consequences on drug policy. They bring to attention the need to monitor the increase of NPS in Brazil while taking preventive measures to avoid reaching the tipping point of an epidemic.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

GMCP assists Member States in enhancing and coordinating their efforts against maritime crime. In Brazil, GMCP has three fronts of action. The first aims to strengthen Brazil’s interagency capacity on river and maritime control and the country's prosecutorial capacity to disrupt organized crime in the Amazon basin, including cross-border cooperation with Northern neighbouring countries. The second focuses on the Southern Tri-Border of Brazil (with Paraguay and Argentina), aiming to equip law enforcement agencies and criminal justice sectors with skills to detect, interdict, investigate and prosecute threats in rivers, especially trafficking.

Thirdly, GMCP promotes cooperation between Brazil and West African countries.In 2023, GMCP held several capacity-building activities. At the beginning of the year, UNODC organized the International Exchange on Operations in the riverine domain, at the Center for Integration and Improvement in Environmental Policing (CIAPA), in Brazil, between Brazil, South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania.Regarding the cooperation between Brazil and Paraguay, GMCP held a Bilateral Tactical Training on Riverine Operations and an International Exchange on Tactical and Operational Approaches to Crime in the riverine domain. Both activities aimed to improve the coordination between Brazilian and Paraguayan efforts against riverine crime in the Tri-Border region.The project made significant efforts to promote South-South cooperation between Brazil and West African countries, namely Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, and Senegal. In November, it organized the Inter-institutional Dialogues to foster the exchange of information between intelligence agents from Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, Senegal, and Brazil. In the same month, GMCP held the first phase of the Diving Course for ship hull sweeping. The course aims to train public security agents in basic and advanced diving to enable them to take part in the second phase of the training, which will enable them to carry out public security dives and conduct ship hull scans. The training was organized in partnership with the Brazilian Federal Police and was attended by nationals from Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, and Senegal.","930000","924018","924018","Under UNODC’s mandate to prevent drug trafficking and organized crime, in 2024, UNODC trained 26 people in Public Security Diving and Ship Hull Inspection to increase the national capacity for detecting illicit cargo as criminal organizations increase the practice of hiding illicit drugs in ship hulls (https://tinyurl.com/bdctjcmr, https://tinyurl.com/2mveawmk). In tandem, GMCP donated public safety diving equipment to the Brazilian Federal Police, to accelerate port inspection of ships headed to export.  Firstly, UNODC offered basic and advanced diving lessons to Brazilian federal police officers and officers from selected West African countries: Senegal, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, and Nigeria, as this is necessary to undergo the specific course on ship hull inspection. Then, this year, the first cohort (06 people) underwent the hull inspection course. The second and third cohorts started the diving training in 2024 and are expected to learn hull inspection in 2025. In 2024, Brazilian divers intercepted half a ton of cocaine in ship hulls at the Santos Port. Investing in South-South Cooperation, UNODC held tripartite meetings to address illicit flows, contraband, and transnational organized crime via river routes: two sessions between Brazil, Paraguay, and Colombia regarding the Paraná-Paraguay Rivers, and two sessions among Brazil, Colombia, and Peru on the Amazon River Basin. In addition, UNODC held two training sessions under the River Operations Exchange Program for public security agents from Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Mozambique in conducting river and riverine operations in the Amazon region, held at the Center for Integration and Improvement in Environmental Police. As a result of the Paraná-Paraguay Rivers talks, UNODC will invest in operational training for river operations to address drug trafficking and illicit flows. In the northern area, the focus was on the exchange of best practices, the practical application of international policies, and the technical review of cooperation memoranda between the countries. Additionally, UNODC held a workshop on multivariate analysis methodologies in Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS), to promote the use of spatial analysis tools to support law enforcement interventions in the fight against organized crime in the triple border region between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.","670000","570000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The project hosted the side event “Innovations in Brazilian Drug Policy” during the 64th session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), which took place between 12 and 19 April 2021. CoE Brazil also organized a webinar to launch its first thematic bulletin: “Management of Assets from Drug Trafficking - Decapitalizing organized crime to strengthen public policies in Brazil” (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1merOwbE710ut1iExyqJGEDiyVNSQX3h8/view). By the end of the year, CoE hosted on 7-8 December the “International Seminar on Illicit Drug Supply Reduction: The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Drug Trafficking”, in which the project launched its first strategic study: ""COVID-19 and drug trafficking in Brazil: the adaptation of organized crime and the actions of police forces during the pandemic” (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CsFHawV6CLCFlGDcUhXVHnE2QcTctfal/view). 
The study provides a broad perspective on the difficulties faced during the pandemic, as well as on the new dynamics of criminal groups that operate in transnational drug trafficking. It seeks to collaborate with the existing field of knowledge on the subject from the analysis of the Brazilian reality with the primary objective of subsidizing and supporting the continuous improvement of institutions that work to fight illicit drug trafficking and public policies in the area.","598561","598561","466512","Aimed at national institutions involved in the response to drug trafficking and organized crime, the project is needed to provided reliable evidence on drug trafficking, its patterns and related themes. The project is furnishing extensive knowledge for the action of national institutions, particularly the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, while also supporting innovative initiatives to respond to this issue. In 2022, evidence to respond to drug trafficking was furnished through the publication, jointly with UNDP and the National Secretariat for Drug Policies and Asset Management (SENAD), of the Strategic Study Dynamics of the illicit drug market in Brazil: Comparative analysis of the prices of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs in four states. The Center also elaborated and published the Third Early Warning Subsystem on Drugs Report, the thematic bulletin Diagnosis of the Forensic Chemistry and Toxicology Laboratories of the Scientific Police of Brazil, the thematic bulletin Illicit Drug Price Monitoring: Lessons learned in Colombia and possible challenges in Brazil, and a report on benchmarking and good international practices for illicit drug supply reduction. These researches are supporting policymakers and law enforcement agencies in Brazil to strengthen the response to drug trafficking based on reliable evidence.https://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/05/cde-realiza-workshops-do-projeto-piloto-para-monitorar-precos-de-drogas-ilicitas-no-brasil-no-estado-de-pernambuco.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/12/estudo-sobre-mercado-de-drogas-ilcitas-no-brasi.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/11/lancam-curso-sobre-trafico-de-drogas-e-crime-organizado-transnacional.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/11/recebem-delegacao-de-mocambique-para-troca-de-experiencia-na-area-de-gestao-de-ativos-originados-do-trafico-de-droga.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/03/unodc-lanca-projeto-piloto-para-monitorar-precos-de-drogas-ilicitas-no-brasil.htmlhttps://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/pt/frontpage/2022/01/subsistema-de-alerta-rpido-sobre-drogas-no-brasil-lana-primeiro-informe.html","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

This project focuses on addressing the work of Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) in Brazil and bordering countries. To enable so, it divides itself into two main objectives: the first aim is to promote the use, in Brazil and Paraguay, of innovative practices to enhance prison management in line with international minimum standards, with a focus on the challenges posed by organized crime in prisons, promoting cooperation between both countries. The second aim is to promote cooperation between Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Colombia in implementing prison management best practices. PRIS-COOP is implemented under UNODC's mandate of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules).","2023-01-01","2025-04-30","Implementation","-","-","UNODC","United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime","The US Government Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs","The US Government Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs","16.4 By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime.,16.a Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime.,17.9 Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation.","16 Peace and Justice - Strong Institutions, 17 Partnerships for the Goals","Brazil","Capacity Development/Technical Assistance, Convening/Partnerships/Knowledge Sharing","-","-","1 - Contributes to gender equality/women’s empowerment in a limited way","","1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights","-","","2 - Sustaining Peace is a significant objective","","Persons deprived of their liberty, Other","Tuane Barbosa",,"1440918","964063","925971","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","490918","490918","490918","Project PRIS-COOP project focuses on addressing challenges posed by Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) in Brazil and bordering countries. It divides itself into two main objectives: the first aim is to enhance prison management in Brazil and Paraguay, with a focus on the challenges posed by organized crime in prisons and on promoting cooperation between both countries. The second aim is to promote cooperation between Brazil, Peru and Colombia in combatting transnational organized crime in the Amazon region.One of the project’s main focuses is capacity-building: in Brazil, 344 prison agents received training, with an average improvement of 60,1% in their knowledge, based on pre- and post-training testing. It also promoted South-South cooperation between Brazil and Paraguay, resulting in 235 Paraguayan officers participating in training sessions conducted by Brazilian experts. In Paraguay, one of the activities was a Training of Trainers (ToT) in Prison Matters; by December 2023, these instructors had trained an additional 373 prison officers.PRIS-COOP organized several capacity-building and policy-focused activities. In Brazil, the project promoted seven (07) training sessions in partnership with the National Secretariat of Penal Policies (SENAPPEN). The project focused on strengthening state-level capacities in prison intelligence, training prison unit directors at the state and federal levels on dynamic security and enhancing the capacities of instructors of the National School for Criminal Services of SENAPPEN. In Paraguay, UNODC facilitated the organization of three (03) training sessions in partnership with Brazilian government agencies at the federal and state levels. The first course, in April, was on prison procedures and routines for the students at the Higher Technical Penitentiary Institute (ITSP) of Paraguay; then, in October, PRIS-COOP held a Training of Trainers on the theme. The third activity was aimed at prison unit Directors, to bolster leadership skills.  Additionally, PRIS-COOP supported four (04) international workshops to promote prison cooperation and police cooperation to address transnational organized crime within and outside prison settings. In parallel, UNODC worked to support Brazil and Paraguay in the theme of the classification of prisoners. In Paraguay, PRIS-COOP supported the development of general guidelines and an action plan for the development of a national classification system.In Brazil, UNODC was appointed as an official member of the National Technical Working Group to elaborate a National Standard on the Classification of Prisoners of the National Secretariat of Penitentiary Policies. The group will propose parameters for the implementation and operationalization of classification by the Brazilian states. UNODC was also invited to support the training of personnel on the SENAPPEN-supported pilot project on the classification of prisoners in Rio Grande do Norte, a Brazilian state which suffered a series of attacks against public buildings, businesses, public and private vehicles by prison-based organized groups in early 2023.","600000","463145","435053","Under UNODC’s mandate to safeguard and implement The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules, and in line with the United Nations System Common Position on Incarceration, over 4,100 prisoners underwent classification interviews in three Brazilian states with UNODC support. In Amapá, the entire prison population (3,317 people) was interviewed by nurses, psychologists, and social workers to identify individual needs (https://tinyurl.com/34kmkcz7). Classification is highlighted in both abovementioned documents as imperative in promoting the resocialization of prisoners, guaranteeing prisoners’ rights – especially to access basic services, work, and education – and improving security for prisoners and prison staff alike. After the initial interviews, each state must advance in 2025 in drafting Individualized Sentence Plans that will contain each prisoner’s personal plan in view of access to education, work, health needs, and more. In 2024, in order to promote best practices in humane prison management, UNODC promoted the Workshop ‘Individualizing Sentences: Implementation of the Classification of Prisoners’ and the First International Seminar on Prison Intelligence (https://tinyurl.com/3xu93rmz); overall, 236 people participated in both events in total. Additionally, the office translated the UN System Common Position on Incarceration. In 2024, UNODC trained 778 penal police officers, prison officers, and other law enforcement agents from Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Colombia on prison management – especially prisoner classification, prison intelligence, and operational protocols. 276 Brazilian penal police and other law enforcement officers were trained on prison intelligence topics(https://tinyurl.com/mpn2mtuc, https://tinyurl.com/488883sn).In Paraguay, 260 prison staff were trained in prison procedures and basic intelligence. Finally, six prison officers from Colombia and Peru participated in a training on prison intelligence held in the north of Brazil.","350000","10000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
