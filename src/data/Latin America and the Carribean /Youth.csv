Creating an environment that is conducive and supportive of youth-led action and youth participation contributes to overall positive social development in the sub-region. 

Young people have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities derived from increased inequalities of income and opportunity. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, youth have been at the forefront, helping their communities overcome challenges caused by the pandemic. SHS supports countries in the Caribbean to prioritize actions and policies that build on the potential of youth and address their needs to allow them to exercise their rights.
This sub-outputs aims at: 
- Strengthened capacities of public officials from CARICOM Member States to apply the principles of meaningful youth engagement in programming and policy. 
- Joint action plan developed to advance the YPS agenda in the English and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. 
- Coordination mechanism created to follow-up on this action plan, including considering the launch of a YPS regional coalition. 
- Strengthened Network of Directors for improved knowledge sharing and exchange on youth engagement. 
-Strengthened capacities of Caribbean youth-led organizations on gender equality and advocacy by developing tools for young people to develop their own project ideas and drive social change in their communities.

It acts as a youth body which will give youth the opportunity to co-design UNESCO’s work on YPS in the Caribbean. Youth from Barbados, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica were engaged for 6+ month period and received capacity development, participated in co-designing/co-delivering workshops and were supported with mentoring/technical advice which enabled them to lead on their own YPS micro-projects. UNESCO consolidated its partnership on youth with the CARICOM Secretariat. One main achievement was the roll-out of the YOUth Matters! Interactive Workshop Series on Meaningful Youth Engagement with a focus on Youth, Peace and Security (June 2022). UNESCO together with the YPS SG and the CARICOM Secretariat trained the Network of Directors, i.e. public officials of youth-related national Ministries of CARICOM MS with representatives from Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Belize, BVI, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, TCI, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Montserrat and Trinidad and Tobago. Follow-up actions included knowledge sharing, connecting policy-makers with the YPS SG, Peace Day communications campaign, and knowledge production envisioned for 2023.Based on the post-assessment results, the Network of Caribbean Youth Directors assessed the achievement of the main objectives of the capacity development. The action enhanced their capacities in reflecting on the principles of meaningful youth engagement, to acquire practical tools to apply policies, programmes and projects for and with youth, to share and exchange information and experiences on meaningful youth engagement practices in the Caribbean and to facilitate a space for exchange among public officials and young people from the English and Dutch-speaking Caribbean to identify entry points to jointly advance the Youth and YPS agenda. Likewise, this action aimed at enhancing the skills of youth to promote gender equality. In this regard, in cooperation with the Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS), University of the West Indies, the 'Caribbean Sheroes Initiative', is a sub-regional Initiative that fosters knowledge creation and capacity development to advance gender equality. Within the framework of the Initiative, in 2022 youth benefitted from the Sheroes Summer school and regional trainings. The Sheroes knowledge toolkit, as well as the Sheroes Manual on Gender Equality, Development and Advocacy were launched in June 2022. In the framework of this initiative, in 2022 the second edition of the Sheroes Academy, with a focus on engaging men and boys in promoting gender equality took place introducing basic concepts in the field of Gender, Development and Advocacy. The academy served as an opportunity for young people to develop their network and meet outstanding scholars, activists and experts that promote women’s rights in the Caribbean. The Sheroes academy also introduced tools for young people to develop their own project ideas and drive social change in their communities. In 2022, youth between the ages of 18-30 from Anguilla, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the Sheroes academy.  In partnership with IGDS, a toolkit on best practices to advance Gender Equality with a focus on Eastern Caribbean CSO's is currently being elaborated.

Additionally, other members of the team were unavailable at times, due to school or work commitments. The attrition of psychologists within the public health system led to infrequent support group meetings and gaps in supervision of the team. With these challenges, the retention rate only increased marginally and there was a maintenance of the ARV adherence with the rate in the previous year. Critically, the public health system must ensure the sustaining of professional support for ALHIV, even while there is a focus on peer engagement and support. Additionally, there is need to mre effectively address the issue of self-stigma among young people with HIV as they proved an issue with acceptance of peer support and also the quality of support delivered.","28000","28000","28000","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In 2023, main strategies included evidence-based advocacy and policy advice, support for youth participation and strengthening of youth networks, as well as the expansion and strengthening of strategic partnerships in youth.Main results achieved include:1.Evidence-based advocacy and technical assistance for design and implementation of policies and programmes on adolescent pregnancy, CSE, GBV, STIs, including HIV, and on preventing and addressing racism and other forms of discrimination. The CO developed permanent advocacy and political dialogue actions involving SRHR of adolescents and young people, such as: a) Publication ""Leaving No One Behind: Pregnancy, Motherhood and Sexual Violence in Adolescence"" (in partnership with CIDACS-Fiocruz Bahia and the Federal University of Bahia, within the joint project ""Inequalities and Pregnancy in Adolescence""), that has been well-received and further disseminated by the media and key partners.b) menstrual dignity - Publication “Recommendations for implementing initiatives to promote Menstrual Dignity” https://brazil.unfpa.org/pt-br/publications/recomendacoes-implementacao-iniciativas-dignidade-menstrual, in order to provide evidences on the access to menstrual rights and dignity; also, UNFPA partnered with the Federal Institute of Pernambuco (IFPE) and the Recife Executive Youth Secretariat (SEJUV) for the promotion of the event ""Youth Health: Leave Flow!”, as a celebration of the International Day of Menstrual Dignity, established on May 28th. Link: https://brazil.unfpa.org/pt-br/news/unfpa-ifpe-sejuv-e-sociedade-civil-promovem-debate-sobre-dignidade-menstrual-em-recife ; c) study elaborated on indigenous health for maping the SRHR needs of adolescents and young people in indigenous territories, in order to support the establishment (by the Secretariat of Indigenous Health of the Ministry of Health) of a “health line of care"" for adolescents and young people (https://redentora.rs.gov.br/site/noticias/terra-indigena/879493-movimento-de-jovens-terra-indigena-do-guarita) and other actions with indigenous youth (https://brazil.unfpa.org/pt-br/news/unfpa-promove-oficina-de-arte-e-educacao-com-mulheres-e-meninas-indigenas-em-manaus); d) support to life-skills education  SCE: dialogues with PSE - health in schools programme, including attending activities such as regional meetings and webinars; also, support to the “Oxe, me Respeite” (in partnership with GRE and the office in Salvador) . 2. Strengthening participation and advocacy capacity of youth networks, government and CSOs, at national and subnational levels, particularly on human rights and SRHR. UNFPA Brazil, with the TA received from LACRO, supported the main participatory dialogue in Brazil for youth, which is the National Youth Conference. The 4th Conference (held in 2023, held in Brasilia in December), brought together around 2,200 young people. UN Brazil had a joint stand at the event in which UNFPA, using an interactive totem, carried out a survey on the main priorities for the Brazilian youth, considering the ICPD+30 dialogues (395 participants indicated Racial equality; Addressing hunger and poverty; Strengthened youth policies; LGBTQIA+ rights; Gender equality). In the coming years, UNFPA will support the National Youth Secretariat (SNJ) in following up and implementing the priorities and recommendations agreed upon in the dialogue. International young government and civil society representatives also had the chance to participate by means of the “Observa Conferencia” (see SSC output).As the coordinator of the UN Brazil Interagency Advisory Group on Youth , UNFPA also advocated for the Brazilian participation in the ECOSOC Youth Forum in NY, in a meeting between the UNFPA Representative in Brazil and the Minister of State, Head of the General Secretariat of Presidency of the Republic, Márcio Macedo, whose portfolio includes the National Youth Secretariat (SNJ). In addition to facilitating the mission of part of the official delegation (April), members of the Brazilian delegation underwent a training on the SDGs (https://brazil.unfpa.org/pt-br/news/unfpa-apoiou-participacao-de-delegacao-brasileira-no-forum-da-juventude-do-conselho-economico-e-social ). The CO also supported the participation of the National Youth Council (CONJUVE) in international spaces, including the participation of a CONJUVE member and young indigenous woman at the 1st LAC Youth Conference in Honduras and at the LAC Regional Conference on Population and Development and in the Montevideo+10 session in Chile in November.Internationally, the CO and LACRO also supported the participation of Youth government institutions (e.g. Manfred Lopes Velarde, Youth Director in Bolívia) during the Amazon Dialogues (Dialogos Amazonicos, Belem, August), event that brought together more than 20,000 people from civil society, governments, academia and the private sector, aimed at guiding the formulation of new public policies for the Amazon region (the results of the discussions were presented to the leaders of the Pan-Amazon countries during the Amazon Summit). Youth-lead activities for national and international youth audiences were promoted by UNFPA, with emphasis on the Transversal Youth Plenary, the Indigenous Youth Plenary and youth lead-workshops (e.g. boldly autonomy and climate change) (https://brazil.unfpa.org/pt-br/news/autonomia-corporal-e-direitos-mudancas-climaticas-dialogos-amazonicos ). Also, aiming to strengthen international exchanges among youth organizations in Brazil and other Portuguese-speaking countries, the CO promoted the International Workshop ""Daqui pra li, de lá pra cá"" with CSOs from Angola, Cabo Verde and Brazil in partnership with CSS. The Workshop was held in Salvador in May, with the participation of 18 young people, and resulted in a two-years Joint Action Plan.Regarding the national context, with a focus on LNOB, the CO designed and implemented for the second year of the initiative ""Inclusive Nós"" to train 21 young people with disabilities (PwD) for the activism on Human Rights and the rights of people with disabilities. 3. Expansion and strengthening of strategic partnerships in youth. A MOU was signed between UNFPA and the National Secretariat of Youth (SNJ) in august 2023. The workplan was focused in: Strengthening public policies and programs aimed at adolescents and young people, with approaches to human rights and promoting equity; Support for the production, systematization and dissemination of updated data, analysis and evidence on adolescents and young people; Strengthening policies, programs and initiatives to promote the rights, sexual and reproductive health and bodily autonomy of adolescents and young people; Promotion of racial and gender equality: actions to prevent gender-based violence, transform violent masculinities and violence against the young population, through the Black Youth Alive Program.Regarding the promotion of protagonism and opportunities for girls specifically in the issue of girls in Science, an MOU was signed between UNFPA and the Federal University of Piaui (UFPI) since 2022 to partner in the qualification of the National Science Olympiad (ONC) by i) strengthening themes of the UNFPA mandate in the content of the tests; ii) strengthening the participation of disabled adolescents and youth; iii) awarding the 5 best participant girls from public schools (one per region of the country). The ONC occurred from August to November in 3 different phases. The award ceremony occurred on December 11 rs 2023.

In 2024, UNFPA Brazil worked to strengthen the capacity of national counterparts, including SNJ, CONJUVE (National Youth Council) and Y20/G20 chairs, for the promotion of the Youth Agenda and the participation of Youth in strategic policy dialogue spaces - with emphasis on the Y20. Y20 is the Official Youth Engagement Group of the Group of Twenty (G20) and enables dialogue between young people from G20 member countries and the elaboration of a Communiqué to be shared with G20 leaders. UNFPA, along with UNICEF, coordinated the UN Brazil Inter-Agency Thematic Group on Youth (GT Juv), which supported the Y20/G20 process in 2024. Capacity building and support to advocacy and policy dialogue activities were held, including the support to the Youth Y20/G20 Summit (12-17 Ago, 2024) in Rio, which brought together 200 international representatives and more than 2,000 young people from Brazil. In addition, UNFPA elaborated a youth data dashboard, with data from G20 countries, to support the dialogues and negotiations that were the base for the elaboration of the Y20 Communiqué. The dashboard was incorporated to the counterparts website, enabling for a broad consultation. Finally, it is important to highlight that the Y20 Youth Communiqué included key issues to the UNFPA mandate. The document mentions, for instance, that “G20 countries [are encouraged] to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning , information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes, using SDG 3.7 as a definition framework.” The document also mentions: access to maternal and child healthcare services; promotion of menstrual dignity; GBV prevention, including in digital spaces (internet safety policies) and including training programs for students, health professionals, and parents focused on sexual-based violence; addressing systemic racism; promotion of mental health services; climate-related health challenges; inclusion of youth women, indigenous, people with disabilities, and vulnerable people in the global governance agenda. Finally, the document also recommends the creation of a Youth Fund to serve as a critical financial resource aimed at enhancing access to services, capacity building and participation.","47000","47000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Additionally, more than 47,000 young people have been engaged on climate change and its impacts in the Eastern Caribbean.The skills of 150 student council leaders in the Turks and Caicos Islands on engagement in school governance were strengthened and the debating and leadership skills of 47 adolescent parliamentarians in Barbados were enhanced, leading to a national debate before policy makers and the public on youths’ views on how crime and violence should be addressed. Children and adolescents’ voices on how their rights were being affected in a post-pandemic era were amplified through the Caribbean Child Research Conference, where 70 children from the Eastern Caribbean submitted entries and their views reached an estimated 2,000 persons. 200 students from Trinidad and Tobago were engaged in the development of messages for their peers and for adults on the prevention of gender-based violence, which reached approximately 775,937 persons on social media platform. Furthermore, the capacity of 65 students was enhanced to become Healthy Ambassadors to promote health and wellness at their schools in Grenada. A total of 9,300 young people across the Eastern Caribbean used the U-Report platform to amplify their voices on several issues ranging from poverty, climate action, educational reform, and political inclusion. These views fed into national policies such as the Dominica Social Protection Policy, the Trinidad and Tobago Child Policy and a youth manifesto, which preceded General Elections in Antigua and Barbuda. Additionally, as part the UN Joint SDG Fund Youth Empowerment Programme, 2123 young people in the Eastern Caribbean completed skills-building modules. The Activate Talk platform remained a key tool embraced by children and youths to reach peers and policy makers with their views. Most notable was a session on Education Reform where four youth panelists and a hybrid audience of 160 young people were able to engage education policy makers from Barbados, Dominica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago on some of the commitments they made during the UN Transforming Summit and present some of their reform suggestions. Another key achievement was the development of an official platform in Antigua and Barbuda for youths to be included in the climate change discussions through the creation of a Youth Engagement Strategy on Climate Action, UNICEF also continued the work developing a novel approach to Gamification on Climate Change, which will be released to the public once the developers finish it in Q1, 2023. Finally, through a partnership with Ashely Lashley Foundation, over 47,000 youths were reached with online messages relating to climate change, disasters and environmental degradation, and a total of 18,513 people were engaged in climate discussions and the first ever Barbados Youth Climate Action Summit was held, enhancing the capacity of about 3,000 children and youths of Barbados to speak on climate change issues. This fed into a youth-led session at the Latin America and the Climate Week 2022 and resulted into a call of action on climate change from the children and youths of Barbados, which was subsequently presented to the Ministry of Environment of Barbados and the government’s delegation heading to COP27. ﻿While the results achieved are significant, the fact that in the first half of the year, governments still had strict restrictions on physical distancing, which limited the number of youths and adolescents who could be engaged in face-to-face. This was countered through the use of online platforms, acknowledging the fact that it can limit participation of those without access. A recent analysis of UNICEF found that only 34 per cent of the global climate policies are child sensitive. There is a need to start engaging more systematically with the Ministries of Environment (or other Ministries responsible for climate and disasters), and to include climate into discussions with ministries that UNICEF already has a relationship with, such as Ministries of Education and Youth. The youth engagement strategy on climate action in Antigua and Barbuda proved to be a great segway into other climate work with other ministries, such as the Ministry of Education, as well as a great opener to conduct similar work also on neighbouring islands.  UNICEF ECA’s Youth Advocates are highly respected, speak fluent English and are in high demand to the extent that they are unable to participate in all opportunities. As such, there is a need to recruit additional Youth Advocates, to scale up the current work and to broaden the representation. Furthermore, there is room to improve the after-actions after the youth advocates have participated in activities to capitalize on the lessons learnt and share their experiences to their vast followers on social media and to champion key events, bringing the global learnings closer to other youth. Finally, it is important to provide financial resources and /or training for youth leaders in fundraising to enable them to sustain their child/youth led projects.﻿Key partners for UNICEF as it sought to empower adolescents to realize their rights were: Ministries of Youth, Ministries of Education, local CSOs such as the Heroes Foundation in Trinidad and Tobago; Child Protection departments and the University of the West Indies Mona Campus. These departments played a key role in mobilizing adolescents to participate.In terms of youth empowerment on climate action, the Department of Environment, within the Ministry of Health, Wellness and the Environment, has been a key partner in Antigua and Barbuda. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, UNICEF has partnered with the department of youth in supporting the country into integrating youth into its climate action. UNICEF has successfully partnered with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on several activities around youth engagement and climate change, including the mutually develop approach to gamification for climate action, as well as the Stockholm+50 consultations around climate change hosted by UNDP, where UNICEF was invited to support on youth engagement. Finally, UNICEF has successfully continued its partnership with the Ashley Lashley Foundation to empower Caribbean youths on climate action through youth-lead research, mentorship programmes and advocacy.","210000","210000","208158","BarbadosThe capacity of young people to advocate on various issues was enhanced through several interventions, including the capacity building of the National Students Council, training in advocacy for 50 members of the national youth parliament and through the U-Report platform. Additionally, 36 children and youth who are engaged in advocacy on climate, mental health and student leadership were trained in deepen their advocacy work in these areas.St. Lucia:U-Report is a flagship digital platform that encourages child and youth participation and engagement. U-Report is a free social messaging tool that enables young persons in St. Lucia and across the OECS to share information and ideas that can be used via common social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. U-Report has also been supporting access to skills development for children and youth.  Through U-Report, young persons have access to FunDoo, a soft-skills learning hub where users aged 13-24 learn by doing practical exercises. FunDoo currently has 20 skills modules including CV Writing, preparing for a Job Interview, Budgeting, Time-Management, and Working as a Team. Currently, there are 627 U-Reporters in Saint Lucia.Three (3) youth advocates from Saint Lucia were among 40 regional youth advocates who received training in Youth Advocacy in Barbados from November 6 – 10, 2023. The five-day regional training workshop reinforced approaches in the UNICEF Youth Advocacy Guide. It also served as a forum for networking among youth advocates. Participants are expected to use the UNICEF Youth Advocacy Guide to support further training of young persons in their respective countries. The 3 youth advocates from Saint Lucia are active in the areas of Mental Health, Climate and the Environment, Student Governance and Leadership.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

It acts as a youth body which will give youth the opportunity to co-design UNESCO’s work on YPS in the Caribbean. Youth from Barbados, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica were engaged for 6+ month period and received capacity development, participated in co-designing/co-delivering workshops and were supported with mentoring/technical advice which enabled them to lead on their own YPS micro-projects. UNESCO consolidated its partnership on youth with the CARICOM Secretariat. One main achievement was the roll-out of the YOUth Matters! Interactive Workshop Series on Meaningful Youth Engagement with a focus on Youth, Peace and Security (June 2022). UNESCO together with the YPS SG and the CARICOM Secretariat trained the Network of Directors, i.e. public officials of youth-related national Ministries of CARICOM MS with representatives from Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Belize, BVI, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, TCI, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Montserrat and Trinidad and Tobago. Follow-up actions included knowledge sharing, connecting policy-makers with the YPS SG, Peace Day communications campaign, and knowledge production envisioned for 2023.Based on the post-assessment results, the Network of Caribbean Youth Directors assessed the achievement of the main objectives of the capacity development. The action enhanced their capacities in reflecting on the principles of meaningful youth engagement, to acquire practical tools to apply policies, programmes and projects for and with youth, to share and exchange information and experiences on meaningful youth engagement practices in the Caribbean and to facilitate a space for exchange among public officials and young people from the English and Dutch-speaking Caribbean to identify entry points to jointly advance the Youth and YPS agenda. Likewise, this action aimed at enhancing the skills of youth to promote gender equality. In this regard, in cooperation with the Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS), University of the West Indies, the 'Caribbean Sheroes Initiative', is a sub-regional Initiative that fosters knowledge creation and capacity development to advance gender equality. Within the framework of the Initiative, in 2022 youth benefitted from the Sheroes Summer school and regional trainings. The Sheroes knowledge toolkit, as well as the Sheroes Manual on Gender Equality, Development and Advocacy were launched in June 2022. In the framework of this initiative, in 2022 the second edition of the Sheroes Academy, with a focus on engaging men and boys in promoting gender equality took place introducing basic concepts in the field of Gender, Development and Advocacy. The academy served as an opportunity for young people to develop their network and meet outstanding scholars, activists and experts that promote women’s rights in the Caribbean. The Sheroes academy also introduced tools for young people to develop their own project ideas and drive social change in their communities. In 2022, youth between the ages of 18-30 from Anguilla, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the Sheroes academy. In partnership with IGDS, a toolkit on best practices to advance Gender Equality with a focus on Eastern Caribbean CSO's is currently being elaborated.

Además, el proyecto busca seguir contribuyendo a la construcción y mantenimiento de la paz, directamente apoyando el empoderamiento y la igualdad de género, así como abordando de manera integral las cuestiones de género. Se han implementado diversas acciones dentro del proyecto, orientadas al empoderamiento de las mujeres y a la igualdad de género, así como al empoderamiento y la participación de los jóvenes. Esto se ha logrado a través de acciones de atención psicosocial dirigidas a mujeres migrantes, así como a mujeres y jóvenes en los territorios de intervención.  Otra acción desarrollada en el marco del proyecto es el trabajo con mujeres migrantes que han sobrevivido a violencia basada en género, mediante intervenciones psicosociales grupales. En estas intervenciones se han enseñado diversas técnicas para hacer frente a las situaciones de vulnerabilidad que muchas de estas mujeres han experimentado a lo largo de sus vidas.

National training will take place in 20232023:Additional time and engagement is needed with the Faith Based Community to enlighten them on CSE and the need for young people to have access to SRH information.Three workshops were conducted on Comprehensive Sexuality Education, two with faith-based leaders/representatives and one with participants from state (MoH, MoE, OPM-GAD)and civil society organisations.  A total of 90 persons participated in these workshops.  There were 49 from faith-based organisations and 41 from state and civil society organizations.Despite significant investment in updating and enhancing the HFLE component to integrate GBV prevention as well as several rounds of national consultations including with faith-based organisations, the revised HFLE curriculum was not approved by the Ministry of Education. The team then pivoted to reprogram funds towards the development of advocacy briefs, sensitization of the major stakeholders with opposition to comprehensive sexuality education and HFLE and engagement with civil society partners. As a result of these efforts strong relationships have been established with the faith community which can be built upon going forward, to support UNFPA’s work in the area of CSE and HFLE.There has been significant push-back to the adoption of the HFLE curricula and CSE from some faith groups and via social media.  Coupled with this push-back thre are challenges surrounding the response which include the following.the time to deliver the CSE training did not allow for in-depth discussion and analysis.the time to deliver the CSE training did not allow for proper teach-back sessions for potential trainers.it is difficult to get the same participants every training day as each day is approximately eight hours.

Additionally, four (4) small grants were approved and finalized under the Spotlight Initiative to support the expansion and scale up of community based work towards ending GBV and improving the technical capacity of CSOs to respond to GBV. During the period SI enhanced coordinated efforts for joint advocacy on ending VAWG with the engagement of a designated CSO officer to boost the institutional capacity of the Civil Society National Reference Group (CSNRG) in 2022. The CSNRG now has its full complement of members with representation across women’s movement, youth, health, men and boys, faith-based community, child rights, LGBTQIA+, persons living with HIV, persons living with disabilities, and the workers unions in Jamaica. The CSNRG’s wide representation of technical expertise will continue to support the principle of LNOB. The increase in the programme’s engagement and partnership with CSOs, particularly at the community level, provided multiple opportunities to expand service delivery reaching marginalized and vulnerable populations. The continued partnership with the European Union (EU) Delegation, in 2022, also played an integral role in the advancement and successful implementation of the SI in Jamaica. During the period, the EU provided strong technical and political leadership through its involvement in the design of the programme’s phase II strategy and more widely, its engagement, advocacy and support around issues such as justice reform, human rights and gender equality and women’s economic empowerment in Jamaica. During 16 Days of Activism, the programme collaborated with the EU on The EU in the Streets[1] a video which also increased awareness of the Spotlight Initiative, while highlighting the government’s progress in addressing GBV in Jamaica.  To further support the sustainability and scaling up of investments achieved in 2022, the Spotlight Initiative’s country team in collaboration with the EUD, government, and CSO implementing partners will develop a programme sustainability plan in 2023. The plan will identify key strategies required to continue the programme’s activities and partnerships, while documenting a roadmap for achieving long-term goals supported by the Spotlight Initiative.
