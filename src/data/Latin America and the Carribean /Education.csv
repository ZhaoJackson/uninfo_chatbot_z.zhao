This increased the visibility of transgender and gender non-conforming people and their needs, built capacity of not just the team at TransWave but of other trans and gender non-conforming advocates, encouraged community leadership, internal growth and stronger advocacy efforts that is and will continue to benefit our community greatly. The following outputs were achieved: 103 persons engaged (43 police officers, 2 social workers, 2 CSO representatives, 56 trans community members). The activity also included consultation sessions with trans community members to get their feedback on their interactions with service providers and how service can be improved and more gender affirming. 8 IECs produced which reached 15,529 online. The IECs related to trans health and wellness, including the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and PrEP. Three (3) videos were developed around mental health and well-being of trans persons in the workplace, identifying methods of affirmation in the workspace to boost employee morale and personal mental health.  13 ambassadors engaged and 3 trans-led initiatives developed as a result. 10 of the 13 participants (76.9%) showed an increase in knowledge around trans-specific advocacy. 100% of ambassadors willing to implement advocacy activities  Engagement and building capacity of trans-masculine people. Support session with 15 people to discuss bridging the gap between acknowledging the struggles across the trans community and to find solutions to support each other.  TransWave was able to complete 100% of project’s activities and, in some cases, surpassed targets. 43 more persons were reached for the service provision and legal educations trainings, produced three (3) more IECs/videos for the media campaign on trans health, reached 7000+ more accounts, had three (3) more trans ambassadors and one (1) more trans-led initiative developed than originally proposed. Due to this, more people were reached to learn more about the lived experiences of trans and gender non-conforming Jamaicans daily.  Through the residential training, participants felt empowered to advocate for legal reform that protects the rights of transgender individuals in Jamaica. They expressed that they found the training to be useful and gained valuable information as it pertains to advocacy methods and resources, and how much work TransWave must do in the background to advocate for the rights and inclusions of the trans community. The activity allowed TransWave to strengthen partnerships with other trans focused groups to promote increased visibility for the community. Participants included representatives from TranscendX, Cari-Trans Support Group, TransForm, Totally Inspiring Trans (TiTs) and Solidarity Yaad.   TransWave offered support to Cari-Trans which aided them in providing support to the trans-masculine community. The support helped in building partnership with Cari-Trans and allowed TransWave to expand its reach and further in understanding and representing especially the trans-masculine community in Jamaica, who have expressed a desire for more representation and visibility. During a session held by Cari-Trans with support from TransWave, 15 persons across the transgender spectrum came together with six (6) of Cari-Trans’ staff to discuss the challenges each community faces.  A media campaign around physical and mental health of trans persons, as well as the residential training which introduced our Trans Health Strategy to participants allowed the organisation to make some progress towards this objective. The campaigns spoke to the effects of HRT on the body and how it can be used to affirm trans persons, but the posts also shared the other effects of HRT to inform interested persons before accessing treatment.

Outputs:
500 complete collections of the General History of Africa in Portuguese were printed and distributed to public schools, key institutions and partners working on providing opportunities for a better understanding of the historical-cultural origin of African matrices in Brazil and their contributions to the construction of national identity.
A webinar took place in November 2021to demonstrate to education partners the importance of using the published materials.

Outcomes:
This project supported the recognition, among schools and educational institutions, of the value of African culture and the importance of its influence on Brazilian history. It contributed to disseminate the value of the African contribution to the history of Brazil and to promote the inclusion of Afro-descendants in the country's educational system, in addition to developing actions to promote racial equality.

New partners that followed the Webinar have contacted UNESCO for possible similar partnerships in other states in the country.

Challenges and lessons-learnt:
It was a challenge to agree on a common list for distribution and also to store the publications once they arrived. The issue was partly solved as the Office was rather empty due to the pandemic and we were able to use the meeting rooms to store the publications. This helped to accelerate the distribution process.

Contribution to C/5 and SDGs:
This project contributed to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 - Quality education, as well as to SDG 10 - Reduction of Inequalities, in addition to contributing to SHS ER1 and the struggle against racial inequalities, it also contributed to ED ER 1.","6043","","5539","The project ended in February of 2022.

In 2020, more than 8.6 million enrollments were registered by the Higher Education Census, with 1.2 million graduating students. In addition, 3.7 million students entered an undergraduate course that year. The survey also found that 323,376 teachers worked at the educational level in 2020. The survey revealed 2,457 higher education institutions in Brazil on the census reference date. Of these, 2,153 (87.6%) are private and 304 (12.4%) are public. Private institutions registered 3.2 million new entrants, representing 86% of the total.
 
Public universities and federal technical institutes in Brazil are now required to reserve at least 50% of the vacancies for the following students:
who have completed high school in public schools (schooling criteria);
with income per capita of up to a minimum wage and a half (socioeconomic criterion);
with a proportional distribution of vacancies among blacks, browns, and indigenous people (ethnic-racial criterion).
 
 
Considering the main results of the last semester, the Project managed to achieve the main proposed results, that is:
Studies on the effectiveness of public universities and higher education institutions on the National Student Assistance Program - PNAES, from 2016 to 2020.
Studies analyze ?ows and methodologies to provide further ef?ciency and e?ectiveness to tax regularity within the scope of the University for All Program (Prouni).
Study to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the internationalization actions of Brazilian Federal Institutions of Higher Education (IFES). 
Developed an analytical study for the adequacy of public universities in the context of the vacancies offered and the number of first-year students.
Developed an analytical study regarding the redistribution of vacancy posts among Public universities. 
Study to identify the impacts of COVID-19 on the Student-Graduate Agreement Program (PEC-G) and the Milton Santos Program for Access to Higher Education ( PROMISES).
 
The pandemic improved the Ministry of Education's relationship with higher education institutions, as well as higher education in Brazil. Health courses, priority and educational strategies were prioritized.
 
Contribution to Global Priority Gender Equality:
Considering that the enrollment profile of women in Brazilian public universities is predominantly concentrated on women, this population group ends up benefiting from the actions developed by the project. That is, the evaluation of the profile of university entrances, as well as the analysis of funding for payment of private universities, proportionally benefits young women. This project contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and UNESCO's global priority for gender equity. The actions guarantee equal access and permanence for all in higher education.

Contribution to Priority Group Youth:
Teenagers and young people are the primary students at Public universities in Brazil. The universities could be linked to the central government, states, and municipalities. The universities' object of this project intervention is the universities connected to the ministry of education, called federal universities. Students at Brazilian higher education institutions have an evident profile: they are white, female, aged between 19 and 24, study in private institutions at night, completed high school in a public school, live with their parents, and have to work to earn an income of up to two minimum wages. In both public and private higher education institutions, most students come from public high schools. In the case of private higher education, 68.5% of students came from public high schools and 31.5% from private. In public higher education institutions, 60.1% came from public high schools, and 39.9% came from private high schools.

The universities' object of this project intervention is the universities connected to the ministry of education, called federal universities.Students at Brazilian higher education institutions have an evident profile: they are white, female, aged between 19 and 24, study in private institutions at night, completed high school in a public school, live with their parents, and have to work to earn an income of up to two minimum wages.In both public and private higher education institutions, most students come from public high schools. In the case of private higher education, 68.5% of students came from public high schools and 31.5% from private. In public higher education institutions, 60.1% came from public high schools, and 39.9% came from private high schools. Considering the main results of the year, the Project managed to achieve the main proposed results:Studies on the effectiveness of public universities and higher education institutions on the National Student Assistance Program - PNAES, from 2016 to 2020.Studies analyze methodologies to provide further efficiency and effectiveness to tax regularity within the scope of the University for All Program (Prouni).Study to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the internationalization actions of Brazilian Federal Institutions of Higher Education (IFES). Developed an analytical study for the adequacy of public universities in the context of the vacancies offered and the number of first-year students.Developed an analytical study regarding the redistribution of vacancy posts among Public universities. Study to identify the impacts of COVID-19 on the Student-Graduate Agreement Program (PEC-G) and the Milton Santos Program for Access to Higher Education ( PROMISES).Study on the demands of parliamentarians on higher education;Study on the judicialization of higher education. The pandemic improved the Ministry of Education's relationship with higher education institutions, as well as higher education in Brazil. Health courses, priority and educational strategies were prioritized.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

- Presentation of a detailed proposal for calls for proposals to establish new partnerships with educational and research institutions to strengthen support for the management of school maintenance programs and for the identification and dissemination of innovative management experiences.
 
2) Main difficulties
The project is still very new, and the project team is not yet familiar with UNESCO's hiring and accountability processes.
 
3) Potential risks and mitigation measures
As the project team, on the part of FNDE, does not yet know in depth the necessary procedures for the execution of the project, there was a risk of hiring being done outside the expected standard. As a mitigation measure, the team has been going through a series of training with the UNESCO team, in order to feel safe to carry out the necessary actions.
 
4) Lessons learned
An important lesson was the constant need for communication and training of FNDE's staff, to ensure that all hirings and accountability are correct.

Through the partnership with UNAIDS, the MoESYI finalized its draft Sexuality Education Training Manual and facilitated the training of 27 HFLE teachers in Sexuality Education. A consultant finalized the training manual based on the existing draft and feedback from the internal review process. A Handbook with content from the manual and the training handouts was also compiled and finalized by the consultant. As part of this project, 27 secondary HFLE teachers were trained in a 4-day residential Sexuality Education training workshop held on October 18-20, 2024, at the Ocean Coral Spring Hotel in Trelawny. The workshop aimed to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills to improve the delivery of the Sexuality and Sexual Health theme in HFLE, as well as increase their comfort level in delivering topics related to sexual and reproductive health.  The training was consistent with the then near-finalized sexuality education training manual and covered six modules as follows:·     Introduction to Sexuality Education·     Understanding Sexuality and Sexual Health Education·     Understanding Sexual Development·     Knowledge Empowers (SRH)·     Gender·     Gender-based Violence All 27 teachers completed the evaluation for the workshop. Only 1 teacher left the workshop in need of immediate support around Gender vs Sex. Areas of interest from the teachers for further capacity building were Human Trafficking, Sexting  Revenge Pornography, Cervical Cancer, Sexual Grooming, social media, and Accessing Health Services. Capacity building sessions will therefore be organized in these areas as resources become available. There is tremendous need for consistent engagement and support for educators tasked with delivering the HFLE Curriculum in schools. This is critical because while information about HIV and AIDS and young people’s sexual and reproductive health needs is readily available, the knowledge levels among educators vary. There is a critical need to provide competency support to build and sustain their comfort in delivering parts of the curriculum they find to be controversial.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The activities started remotely considering the pandemic scenario, and nowadays, the actions are being developed directly in the schools. The Project focused on the prevention and well-being of people living with HIV and AIDS. This achievement results from continued action public policies that have been maintained and expanded, in addition to working with committed professionals and institutions. It has been working on HIV prevention with the most vulnerable populations: young people (especially students), men who have sex with men, transvestites, female sex workers, and drug users. Considering the main results of the year, the Project managed to achieve the main proposed results:Development of studies to comprehend the dynamics of the HIV epidemic focused on a vulnerable population. Development of education, communication, and information strategies on health education and HIV prevention.Implement a particular strategy focused on young people in schools related to health and sexuality education – Geracao consciente project.The activities of this Project are always focused on gender equality and gender mainstream. The Project always seeks to guarantee access to condoms. However, other alternatives to HIV prevention strategies, such as combined prevention and focus on the most vulnerable populations, are always considered. As part of the scope of the Project's objectives, it promotes studies and research on epidemiological, behavioral, and effectiveness trends in STI / HIV / AIDS. It developed: a cascade of care with an estimate of those infected with HIV; epidemiological and assistance analyses of HIV and AIDS; epidemiological analysis of viral hepatitis reports; research related to notifications of pregnant women with HIV / AIDS; studies related to cases of congenital syphilis; analyzes similar to syphilis during pregnancy. The Project has provided Management with the development of actions that contribute to studying the dynamics of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the state and strengthening Management's governance capacity.The production and systematization of technical-scientific information have become an essential strategy for reaching health professionals and contributing to public political processes.Women, including Lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals, were the population group with the most data produced. Currently, the HIV epidemic affects more young people, so the focus of the Project's actions was aimed at young people. Both research, interventions, and strategies considered young people, men who have sex with men and women in situations of social vulnerability and difficulty accessing education and health services.The Project's main objective is to work with primary and secondary education students on health education, sexuality education, and HIV prevention topics. The Project works with the largest municipalities (cities) in the Rio Grande do Sul.

There are coordinated actions in schools—training activities for health education and traffic education professionals. It has been working on Health education, Health promotion at schools, and HIV prevention with the most vulnerable populations: young people, LGBTQI+ and indigenous groups. This achievement results from continued action public policies that have been maintained and expanded, in addition to working with committed professionals and institutions. A diagnosis of health education strategies for the state's indigenous population was carried out, and a study on the health situation of the most vulnerable LGBTQIA+ population with proposals for health education strategies. Considering the main results of the year, the Project managed to achieve the main proposed results:Assessment of the epidemiological situation of the indigenous people;Development of educational material for HIV prevention, other STIs, and covid;Held a face-to-face event with education and health professionals related to health education strategies.The activities of this Project are always focused on gender equality and gender mainstream. The Project always seeks to guarantee access to condoms. However, other alternatives to HIV prevention strategies, such as combined prevention and focus on the most vulnerable populations, are always considered. Involvement with organized civil society is still a fundamental axis of project actions.  The Project also involves gender mainstream as an essential axis. Besides, it ensures that evidence-based strategies are the driving axis of the project actions.Currently, the HIV epidemic affects more young people, so the focus of the Project's actions was aimed at young people. Both research, interventions, and strategies considered young people, men who have sex with men and women in situations of social vulnerability and difficulty accessing education and health services.The Project's main objective is to work with primary and secondary education students on health education, sexuality education, and HIV prevention topics.

Approximately 5,417 key stakeholders in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago , Virgin Islands UK and the Turks and Caicos Islands benefitted from professional development sessions in supporting home-based learning, using materials effectively in structured play to enhance numeracy, literacy, language and communication , learning to identify and respond to children showing signs of developmental delay and integrating technology using online platforms with content for young learners.Advocacy and communication were key mediums for sharing information on quality ECD with targeted stakeholders and the public. The Ministry of Education in Grenada, with the support of the Ministries of Health and Social Development implemented an intersectoral advocacy campaign to ensure that the public had access to information about the overall benefits of quality ECD for children, families and the wider community emphasizing topics such as early brain development, active learning, positive parenting, keeping children safe, health and nutrition etc. Information was shared via social media platforms, television, radio with more than 4,000 views on the Ministry’s website.Using the generation of evidence as a critical strategy to support systematic planning, decision-making and to advance policy initiatives for inclusive ECD and Education, UNICEF ECA supported the comprehensive Diagnostic Review of the status of the ECD Sector in the 12 programming countries and territories. Consultations reflected the perspectives of more than 200 key informants across the region. The data revealed positive progress in key areas - implementation of ECD Policies, Standards and Regulatory Frameworks for provision of quality ECD services, the utilization of Regional Frameworks promoting effective curriculum delivery through child friendly environments for purposeful play and utilization of operational guidance promoting compliance with quality standards. Positive progress was reflected in training for parents, ECD practitioners and other caregivers on supporting holistic development in homes and communities, keeping the focus on Early Moments Matter. The research also revealed that there is more to be done to support countries to implement integrated approaches for planning, implementing, and monitoring of ECD programmes and services across the sectors of Education, Health, and Social Development.In collaboration with the respective governments, UNICEF supported the comprehensive review and updating of the ECD Policy, Regulations and Standards Frameworks in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Montserrat with these countries placing significant emphasis on the articulation of more integrated approaches to ECD for children 0-8 years. Going forward UNICEF ECA will support the implementation of Policy Initiatives including strengthening mechanisms for effective governance, coordination, implementation and monitoring of integrated ECD programmes, support for holistic development in homes and communities and support for early identification, intervention, and improved learning outcomes for children with developmental delays/disabilities.Through UNICEF support, the Ministry of Education in St. Kitts and Nevis strengthened and supported the establishment of Toy Lending Libraries. These libraries support the principles of learning through play by providing ECD Service providers and teachers with access to developmentally appropriate materials and equipment for learning on a rotation basis. Six hundred and fifty-two (652) ECD practitioners, Teachers and Centre supervisors benefitted from professional development sessions which focused on building their capacity to make multi-purpose use of toys and manipulatives, to enhance child engagement, development and learning. Approximately 2,069 children, 0-5 years are enjoying more interactive and structured play using the materials being borrowed from the Toy Lending Libraries.The Integrated approach to ECD at country level has proven to be highly effective to support holistic development of young children. It now requires institutionalization and development of mechanisms both at the country level as well as at UNICEF internally to further strengthened integration approach across health, education and social development sectors.A key partnership with the Child Development and Guidance Centre and the Ministry of Education in St. Lucia resulted in the completion of an online learning platform and the launching of a new e-learning web series for young learners called Kaleidoscope Adventures. The website provides access to learning activities for children, 0-5 years and is part of a wider project which aimed to provide parents, teachers and other caregivers with knowledge and skills, and to support learning and development at home and in communities. This initiative was born as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw children in the ECD sector with limited access to quality play and learning in their homes. Since the launch in the first quarter of 2022, more than 5,000 children and families have accessed the platform and engaged with the activities.","104000","104000","101750","GrenadaIn collaboration with the Ministry of Education, UNICEF supported Professional Development Training Workshops during the Summer Holidays for Pre-primary and Kindergarten Teachers from Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Emphasis was placed on the adult child interaction at the early childhood centres and schools with a focus on creating supportive environments, making effective use of strategies to help the preschoolers to resolve conflict, and adopting a problem-             solving approach to social conflict at the preschool and kindergarten level. Two hundred and     eighty-two (282) pre-primary and kindergarten teachers received the training over a two-week duration with more than 2,000 children benefitting from improved learning and care       environments        .      In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, 240 Early Childhood Educators have enhanced capacities in Effective Curriculum implementation, Instructional Leadership and Student Engagement. More than 2,000 preschoolers are benefiting from improved learning environments. Additionally, as part of the Ministry of Education’s Transition Policy, 56 Primary Schools received developmentally appropriate materials for interactive learning in kindergarten classes. More than 2, 185 children are benefitting from improved learning environments.MoE also focused on strengthening inclusive environments. Thirty-One Early Childhood Educators have been sensitized to support the learning and development needs of children with a focus on ADHD, Deafness and Speech and Language delays.The focus on Health and Safety in ECD settings continued with Sixty-Four (64) Preschools receiving supplies for hand washing, sanitizing and daily cleaning of furniture, learning equipment and furniture.MontserratA partnership with the University of the West Indies Cave Hill and the Ministry of Education resulted in a Special Education Diagnostic Clinic being convened by the Ministry of Education to identify those requiring learning and developmental support. During the Clinic sessions, 33 Students from the Primary and Secondary Schools received structured Educational and Psychological assessments, with 83.3% of those assessed being male students. A plan for support for the students will be developed.St. Lucia:Child Development and Guidance Centre (CDGC) and Dove Media Productions, a Parent Education Series, titled “Bonding” has been produced. This is an important innovation in the Eastern Caribbean Region, which when aired on the various media channels, has the potential to reach all families in St. Lucia with valuable information about positive parenting and caregiving. The Series will launch in January 2024. Additionally, under the ECD programme more than 2,000 children in the early childhood sector are benefitting from improved learning environments after Two Hundred and Ninety (290) Early Childhood Educators received training in using developmentally appropriate practices with young children.St. Vincent and the Grenadines In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the promotion of exclusive breast feeding up to 6 months as a best practice for the infant and family continues. Advocacy material is being developed through the development of Human- Interest Stories to be shared with the public.St. Kitts and Nevis In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the International Child Resource Institute (ICRI) sixty-three (63) children (0-5 years) have been engaged in early stimulation, play and learning in activity zones during their Infants’ and toddlers’ clinics in 2 health centers in Nevis. During the sessions in the activity zones parents and caregivers have received coaching to improve their play and communication with the children. Additionally, approximately 40 Educators, Social workers and Health Sector personnel participated in online training sessions on active learning and holistic development leading up to the opening of the Health Centre spaces in Nevis.In collaboration with the Department of Social Services, Nevis, UNICEF continued its support for the Second Chance Teen Mothers’ program through exposure to knowledge and the development of necessary skills and competencies to be able to provide the best quality early childhood development for their children. A developmental session which focused on the importance of providing young children with Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) to ensure sustainable learning and development during the life cycle have been facilitated.

This result is expected to contribute to improved learning of 145,000 children and enhanced teaching support for 11,400 teachers across the countries in the region. 456 children from vulnerable families got better access to education through the provision of digital devices. Youth engagement and participation in safe school initiative have been enhanced. In addition, the Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA) initiative as part of Generation Unlimited was commenced with the aim to provide a digital marketplace for youths.UNICEF ECA continued its support towards providing better digital learning opportunities for children in the countries of the region. In partnership with the OECS, 900 curriculum aligned digital learning contents for K-6 grades have been developed and are ready to be launched for public dissemination in early 2023. This provides digital learning opportunity to primary education students in five participating countries: Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis. 400 teachers have been trained in the use of digital content development tools to create these learning resources. In addition, UNICEF ECA collaborated with Ministry of Education in Turks and Caicos Islands, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada and Barbados to enrich digital learning resources for kindergarten, primary and secondary education. As a result, the capacity of 268 teachers and Education officials across six countries have been enhanced in effective use of digital skills in producing high quality digital learning resources. Consequently, 25,768 digital learning resources were developed. It is expected that 145,000 children and 11,400 teachers in the six countries will benefit from usage of these resources, which will contribute to improved learning outcome for students. UNICEF provided further support to the Ministry of Education in Trinidad and Tobago in developing five digital textbooks for primary and secondary. Moreover, newly developed self-training toolkit on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skill to use the Ministry's Learning Management System as well as web-based pedagogy instruction was used to train 100 primary and secondary education officers. These were also made available in both hard (500) and soft copies to allow access for all teachers. Some 456 students from vulnerable families in Trinidad and Tobago benefitted from the provision of a laptop in support of their continuity of learning. In terms of connectivity, UNICEF worked with ITU to pilot a capacity expansion project in primary and secondary schools in Barbados. This project included an assessment of usage and temporary upgrades for selected schools. Subsequent assessments will be completed to collect quantitative data on usage and the impact of expanded access and capacity at the given schools. With UNICEF ECA contribution, the 3rd Ministerial Forum of the Caribbean Safe School Initiative (CSSI) and Youth Forum during 11th Caribbean Disaster Management Conference were organized successfully. The forums offered the opportunity to reflect upon the changes and challenges the Caribbean has faced since launching the CSSI. They also provided the platform for youth to engage in discussion and express their voice and opinion on the issue.As part of GenU initiative, UNICEF ECA commenced the rolling out of YOMA in Trinidad and Tobago with the aim to establish it as one of the primary mechanisms to engage, reach, and impact young people. As part of the initiative, social impact activities aimed at motivating and engaging youth more actively in addressing some key issues related to youth entrepreneurship, climate change are being designed. Moreover, preparation works to launch a localized YOMA platform in first quarter of 2023 have commenced.﻿A key lesson learned was the fact that blended education, especially the online delivery of education, is much more complex than previously thought. Curriculum based Content development, connectivity and availability of devices are just a few initial steps. Strategic planning needs to take place at the ministerial level, at the school level and classrooms for effective and efficient delivery. If an appropriate stepwise strategy is not devised, premature delivery of online education can further enhance the digital divide contributing to further inequity for the already disadvantaged groups.In addition to respective Ministries of Education in the countries, UNICEF ECA continued its partnership with regional bodies such as the OECS and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) to implement digital learning and safe school related initiatives. New partnerships with the private sector are being explored in support of rolling out of YOMA in Trinidad and Tobago.","212000","212000","207602","AnguillaIn collaboration with the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Ministry of Education, 57 teachers from the early childhood, primary and secondary school sectors have enhanced knowledge and skills to support their children and students to manage their behavior and understand positive approaches to discipline.British Virgin Islands Return to Happiness training was conducted in BVI in which 46 participants across all sectors participated.

Recognized as a featured learning recovery effort by the MOEY, the LP is well-positioned to grow to support mainstream learning through the secondary level, ongoing capacity development of teachers on remote learning and provide continuity during any future school closures. 932 lessons across 19 categories were developed and sector sensitizations were staged through webinars, workshops and social media activations including a summer series with playful, age-appropriate, culturally relevant, Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) content that garnered 500 views and directed students to the LP using a QR code. A FLN focused “Cornershop Challenge” poster was distributed to 100 locations island-wide in partnership with a telecommunication company’s foundation. That social media reel received 209,000 views. The EMIS pilot was completed in 20 schools potentially impacting 2000 students. 87 administrators participated in training on eight data points related to student and teacher attendance, behaviour, and student assessment.   Penetration tests were completed and the EMIS platform is preparing to go live aiming for full roll out within 2 years.The JCO made progress on inclusive content development with two of the targeted 12 accessible digital books reaching some 3777 users and the remaining ten slated for dissemination in 2024. Two ADT informational webinars were attended by some 700 teachers. Innocenti released its report on the pilot with specific recommendations for inclusive digital teaching and learning in the Jamaican context. Support to safer school environments continued to be prioritised. A total of 409 schools received trainings on implementing the student-centred School-wide Positive Behaviour Intervention and Support (SWPBIS) framework, potentially impacting some 250,000 students. Twenty master trainers completed PFA training to help create SWPBIS aligned communities of care in 2024. Thirty-one participants also completed the Spotlight Initiative funded Leadership for Safer School (LSS) programme, while, through the same funding source, 611 students with disabilities and 152 of their parents and teachers received GBV training.  100 school leaders completed Child Friendly Schools (CFS) training and 100 teachers completed the Jamaica Teaching Council’s second PFA-based Return to Happiness (RTH) course Together these initiatives support ongoing efforts towards improved mental health and psychosocial support sector-wide. Surveys of these course participants are underway to enable identification of best practices in how schools can prioritize children’s rights throughout 2024.The JCO  provided technical assistance to the finalization of a national character education training plan aligned with the SWPBIS scale-up, as well as the national Education Transformation Oversight Council and the National Violence Prevention Commission.  Finally, the school wellness survey, the Welbin Index, was disseminated to key stakeholders and to some 500 individual schools (accounting for almost 70% of all primary and secondary schools). Efforts were also made to involve youth in program design and implementation, referencing relevant U-Report polls and facilitating ongoing dialogue with JCO Youth Council members.","524000","257000","256779","To support improved data-driven decision-making, leading to more student-centered and effective educational support, resource allocation and increased sector resilience, the national EMIS roll out started in 245 schools identified by the education ministry based on device and internet access. This represents the first phase of an SDG fund digital education focused joint programme that began implementation in September. In addition, 1100 principals were sensitized to the EMIS through the UNICEF developed EMIS behaviour change management strategy required to ensure buy in and encourage the onboarding of all primary and secondary schools between 2024-26. EMIS data collection started with Attendance and Behaviour modules along with the school census. A digital audit instrument, slated to become interoperable with the EMIS, was also completed with UNICEF support and staff members of the Technical and Vocational Unit were trained to facilitate the creation of a database of the physical resources available in the 15 technical and agricultural high schools to better determine where technical support and resources are most needed.  Data driven efforts to address sector inequity also included content creation. Ongoing promotion of the FLN focused Learning Passport (LP) platform (following successful completion of the pilot) and of the complete 12-book Accessible Digital Textbook (ADT) series as core components of the education ministry’s online summer school has led to over 8000 users since both went live in mid-2024. The ADTs are featured on the LP and the JCO developed “Summer Spark” online Instagram series and “Cornershop Challenge” poster which features a QR code linked to the LP was reprinted and distributed to 100 locations island-wide through a partnership with a local telecommunication company’s foundation. A UNICEF led workshop with publishers and Jamaica’s signing of the Marrakesh Treaty has also confirmed interest in developing guidelines for the incorporation of universal design for learning principles into the country’s textbook approval process.  Efforts to empower teachers to create safe, supportive, inclusive, and growth-oriented learning environments also continued, with 191 school leaders completing various CFS-focused programmes potentially impacting some 25,000 students, 50 more schools completing training related to the Schoolwide Positive Behaviour Intervention and Support (SWPBIS)/VAC framework pushing the number of schools using this methodology to close to 600 (60% of primary and secondary schools). MHPSS also emerged as a key element of instruction with the total of teachers and volunteers having completed aligned training in the PFA focused Return to Happiness (RTH) approach and socio-emotional learning, rising to over 1000. This includes 530 teachers from the regions most affected by Hurricane Beryl and members of the 63 Communities of Care teams who support Guidance Counsellors in SWPBIS scale up efforts island-wide. In addition, 15,000 students received copies of the “Be Prepared,” disaster preparedness and response activity guide following the July passage of Hurricane Beryl as part of in-school based PFA sessions in the 45 most affected schools. These also included the creation and distribution of PFA support kits. An online version of “Be Prepared” was also shared sector wide. 348 recreation kits remain positioned with the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM). UNICEF continued to support Education in Emergency (EiE) efforts providing substantial technical and financial assistance to the finalization of the Safe Schools Policy. School-based emergency guidelines and disaster preparedness and response plans will form part of the EMIS in its phased rolled out.  ","30000","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The activities of this Project are always focused on gender equality and gender mainstream. The Project always seeks to guarantee access to condoms. However, other alternatives to HIV prevention strategies, such as combined prevention, as a focus on the most vulnerable populations, are always considered. Involvement with organized civil society is still a fundamental axis of project actions. New technologies are always designed to access these populations and to foster access to treatment and prevention. Besides, it ensures that evidence-based strategies are the driving axes of all project actions.
There were not many Project's actions during 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is a forecast of continuity of preventive operations - remote and in face-to-face - with civil society for the second half.
In the second half of 2020, 35 civil society organizations were selected to support actions in the territory for HIV prevention, other STIs with COVID as the central axis. Actions are starting and are expected to last throughout 2021.
Besides, it is essential to highlight that this Project contributes to 40 C/5 and SDG achievement. As can be seen in the success of the expected outcomes and goals and objectives:
Major Program I, Expected Result: 6.
Goal 3: (3.3, 3.5, and 3.d) Through access to condoms and combined prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable and key populations for the epidemic.
Goal 4: (4.7, 4.a). Investing in lifelong education in partnerships with organized civil society and NGOs that invest in the education of people living with HIV/AIDS. Besides, the Project invests in distance education strategies and face-to-face training of young people as strategic alternatives for training young leaders for HIV.
Goal 10: (10.3 and 10.4). Promoting gender equity actions, implemented through sexual diversity, access to health services.","423667","457560","388361","The Project's goal is to apply Result-based management and Governance in the implementation of the National Policy for STD/HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of Preventive Education Programs toward the most vulnerable population. The Brazilian Health Ministry is a UNESCO greater partner and has been working on HIV prevention with the most vulnerable populations: young people, men who have sex with men, transvestites, female sex workers, drug users. To do so, UBO and the Project have established strategies to reach the most vulnerable populations easily in the territory. This Project supported formal education programs, enhancing Program Health in School and Project Health and Prevention in School, from which we implement EDUCAIDS in Brazil. However, considering the political conservative scenario in the country, schools are just talking about prevention against specific groups. During 2020, there are almost no school opened. The public schools were opened util the middle of March, considering the sanitary emergency. Also, informal education activities will be developed in partnership with civil society organizations that work with society's most vulnerable segments.The Project managed to achieve the main proposed results:Developing eight distance education courses for health professionals, education professionals, organized civil society, and young people; These courses are being incorporated into the Ministry of Health's distance education platform to ensure greater access.Twenty NGOs were selected to work with HIV prevention and health promotion. Actions are focused on the most vulnerable populations and key populations for HIV.Exhibitions and debates on the combined prevention of HIV and syphilis were held.Investing in lifelong education in partnerships with organized civil society and with NGOs that invest in the education of people living with HIV / AIDS. Besides, the Project invests in distance education strategies and face-to-face training of young people as strategic alternatives for training young leaders for HIV.As part of the scope of the Project's objectives, it is to promote studies and research on epidemiological, behavioral, and effectiveness trends in STI / HIV / AIDS. The Project, in partnership with some publica universities such as University of São Paulo developed some studies related to these issues. It developed: a cascade of care with an estimate of those infected with HIV; epidemiological and assistance analyzes of HIV and AIDS; epidemiological analysis of viral hepatitis reports; analyzes related to notifications of pregnant women with HIV / AIDS; analyzes related to cases of congenital syphilis; analyzes similar to syphilis during pregnancy. The Project has provided Management with the development of actions that contribute to analyzing the dynamics of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the state and the strengthening of Management's governance capacity.The production and systematization of technical-scientific information have become an essential strategy for reaching health professionals and contributing to public political processes.Women, including Lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals, were the population group with the most data produced. Consequently, new strategies of action and professional training.Currently, the HIV epidemic affects more young people, so the focus of the project's actions was aimed at young people. Both research, interventions, and strategies considered young people, men who have sex with men and women in situations of social vulnerability and difficulty accessing education and health services.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

High-level advocacy briefs on the legal status of corporal punishment in all 12 programme countries, development of a draft Victims’ Rights Policy and 19 new draft laws against gender-based violence in Grenada, and the opening of the child-friendly Family Court Division in Antigua and Barbuda were among initiatives which have the potential for long-term, transformative impact for protecting girls, boys and women through legal and policy reform and institutional strengthening. The Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) registered an uptick in gun-related violence, family violence as well as school-based interpersonal violence among peers, sustaining concern over the issue of Violence Against Children (VAC). UNICEF supported governments to continue tackling the issue through a multi-pronged approach. Within this output, UNICEF supported governments through technical assistance to improve their institutional frameworks to prevent and respond to VAC. There were several notable achievements. One was the production of key advocacy briefs towards ending state sanctioned use of corporal punishment. This resulted in increased knowledge of stakeholders on the legal status of corporal punishment in each of the 12 ECA countries and territories, where the eye-opening research highlighted persistent legislative gaps. In Grenada, a draft Victims’ Right Policy and 19 pieces of draft legislation for ending family and gender-based violence are being considered by the new administration. In Antigua and Barbuda, the first Family Court Division was opened in July 2022, with the technical and financial support of UNICEF. Cases can be lodged via the e-portal and the people-centred nature of the court whether through in-person or virtual hearings, is already helping reduce stigma associated with gender-based violence and child abuse, making the process more user-friendly, efficient and effective. In Trinidad and Tobago, a National Protocol for the Prevention and Management of Child Abuse and National Child Safeguarding Strategy were delivered in support of government’s response to curtailing VAC. This was also supported by the roll-out of Primero Child Protection Case Management Information System increasing the capacity of frontline workers by reducing administrative burdens and supporting better quality case work. The issue of children’s online safety was brought to the fore with programming through the OECS Education Unit and associated awareness building of approximately 121 frontline workers to improve the safety of children’s online presence. Lastly, advocacy and support were provided to the Barbados and St Kitts and Nevis governments to ensure that forthcoming legislation eliminates all forms of corporal punishment to better adhere to the international standards for children’s alternative care.    The use of corporal punishment and the belief that it is a necessary form of discipline to reduce the surge in general societal violence is widespread. Policymakers have also demonstrated an understanding that community crime undermines positive parenting. However, they were hesitant to take bold legislative changes that negatively affected public opinion. Another challenge was the increased school-based violence, where teachers and children needed to re-embrace the positive behaviour management strategies after two straight years of online interaction caused by the COIVD-19 measures. This temporary phenomenon gave rise to political promises for harsher responses to ‘soft approaches’ on children in Antigua and Barbuda ahead of general elections. Together these realities mean that UNICEF ECA’s consistent advocacy and support for the development and implementation of new laws, policies, protocols, and attitudes to support the prevention and response to VAC will be critical over the medium to long term.  ﻿Globally, as more countries legally prohibit the practice of corporal punishment and document their circumstances, a lesson learned for the Eastern Caribbean is that apart from use of countries’ parliamentary processes to outlaw the use of physical force against children, activists will need to consider other strategies for accelerating banning corporal punishment through public interest litigation and judicial condemnation.   Strategic partnerships with global actors End Corporal Punishment and the European Union/United Nations Spotlight programme, together with relevant national Child Protection agencies, ministries of legal affairs [and their legal drafting departments and the civil society organization (CSO)], Grenada National Organisation of Women, were critical to the systems strengthening initiatives implemented in 2022. The latter championed policy and legislative initiatives while the CSO partner was key in public awareness activities as they link to historically marginalized communities. In addition, in both Spotlight countries - Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective Spotlight Working Groups offer support needed to drive the policy and legislative agenda across the sectoral work of the many UN partners. ","146000","65000","62264","Dominica:In 2023, UNICEF and other partners’ long-term advocacy resulted in the parliamentary approval of key laws that ban behaviour that can harm children or require action to protect children. This suite of laws comprised the Children (Care and Adoption) Act, which provides for the care and protection of children, operation of adoption services and for related matters; Domestic Violence Act which provides greater protection for victims of domestic violence and makes provision for granting protection orders and for related matters; Maintenance of Children Act which provides for maintenance of children in conformity with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the connected and incidental matters; and the Status of Children Act which provides for equal status of children, removes all discriminatory provisions in the laws relating to a child born out of wedlock and provides for related matters.GrenadaThrough the EU UN Joint Spotlight on gender-based violence (GBV), UNICEF collaborated with PAHO to ensure that 75 service providers knew how to apply the draft Victims’/Survivors’ Rights Policy and the standard operating procedures to their work with the affected population. UNICEF technical assistance also supported the near finalization of bills to improve the legislative framework for preventing and responding to GBV. This includes an outright ban on preventing pregnant girls from mainstream education and on the use of corporal punishment in educational settings. The accountability mechanism for the draft Victims’/Survivors’ Rights Policy was established to ensure cabinet approval of the policy before year-end. To facilitate passage of the draft legislation, UNICEF ensured that parliamentarians had strengthened capacity to use parliamentary procedures, integrate gender concerns into their ongoing work in the Houses of Parliament and take specific bipartisan actions to address gender-based and family violence, as this will be key to the societal transformations required.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines UNICEF supported the Child Development Division, Ministry of National Mobilisation in the implementation of the Primero Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS+) to enhance child protection systems strengthening in emergency and non-emergency settings and improve case management from identification and registration, to assessment, case planning, referrals and transfers, and case closure.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

EBSERH has undergone profound changes in its value proposition to society and has a new strategic map, which implies new priorities, challenges, and changes in the project scope.It is also important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in the project and affected hiring, so that, from the consultants hired, only one delivered products, because all the others were hired between November and December 2021, and therefore did not have time to make their deliveries.This project started in the second year of Ebserh's activities, in a context where the first professionals from the headquarters were still being hired and the first hospitals were making up the network, whose priority was its integration and consolidation.

To overcome the situation, a review of the project's results was carried out to align the project with the real needs of the EBSERH Network. Even in a challenging scenario, eight consultants were hired in 2021 who are currently conducting important studies with the intention of improving the processes of the EBSERH Network and that should be finalized in 2022.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Furthermore, there were concerns that schools independently made decisions about what aspects of the sexuality and sexual health module to implement, with some principals placing less priority on HFLE because it is not an examinable subject.

Moreover, the project managed to develop research, studies, and technologies for the most vulnerable population to HIV in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The gender component is substantial in the project and has been addressed by the project coordination and civil society. Considering that this is an HIV prevention project and addressed to key populations for the AIDS epidemic, the gender issue should not be excluded in this response. In this way, dealing with transvestites, transsexuals, young men, and black women were aspects identified by the project and are directly related to the scope of both ODG and C / 5.
The strategies of intersectoral relations among education and health are fundamental for the AIDS response in the territory. In these aspects, the AIDS program in Rio de Janeiro has been articulated with state and municipal education secretariats to work on sexuality education issues and HIV / AIDS prevention. The 2021 external evaluation shown these powerful results.
The financial execution has been fulfilled considering quality, best cost-benefit for the project, and impartiality in the selection.","124476","134434","114103","The Project is focused on the most vulnerable groups for STI and HIV in the State of Rio de Janeiro, considering that the HIV incidence is rising rapidly, particularly in some socially vulnerable groups, and therefore deserving a priority in policymaking. Among these groups are youth, drug users, migrants, sex workers, MSM, transvestites, and homeless people. It is estimated that people with less than 25 years now are half of the new HIV infections, which justifies targeted approaches and the construction of specific strategies for preventing disease in the school environment. This scenario demands an investment of human, financial, and technological structures for effective responses to the epidemic based on two complementary axes that require coordinated approaches: prevention and reducing impacts.The Project focused on designed new prevention methodologies with the Secretariat of Education to orient the redefinition of prevention strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations targeted for adolescents and young people.As part of the scope of the Project's objectives, it is to promote studies and research on epidemiological, behavioral, and effectiveness trends in STI / HIV / AIDS. The Project, in partnership with one of the largest Brazilian universities - UFRJ - organized a working group to discuss lines of research of interest to the Project: in two components: epidemiological and socio-behavioral.It developed: a cascade of care with an estimate of those infected with HIV; epidemiological and assistance analyzes of HIV and AIDS; epidemiological analysis of viral hepatitis reports; analyzes related to notifications of pregnant women with HIV / AIDS; analyzes related to cases of congenital syphilis; analyzes similar to syphilis during pregnancy. The Project has provided Management with the development of actions that contribute to analyzing the dynamics of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the state and the strengthening of Management's governance capacity.The production and systematization of technical-scientific information have become an essential strategy for reaching health professionals and contributing to public political processes.One of the Project's most strategic strategies was civil society's participation in developing preventive actions and the development of new non-formal education technologies. Eight NGOs are being hired to reach vulnerable groups. The project will be implemented during 2023.The achievement of this objective has contributed to the expansion of sustainability and technical capacity. Moreover, the development of methodological processes that enable different ways to use technologies (media and social networks, platforms collaborative, among other initiatives) aimed at populations and population groups that require communication and dialogue alternatives for the success and incorporation of preventive measures and behaviors.It is noteworthy that the Project has gone through some political and financial crises since its beginning, impacting its implementation. So that some activities could not be carried out and some results could not be achieved. Since the signing of the Project, the Project has passed through seven state health secretaries. Besides, the state government of Rio de Janeiro experienced a severe financial crisis and fiscal recovery. This issue affected the capacity to provide the necessary infrastructure for the technical activities of the Project.As part of the scope of the Project's objectives, it is to promote studies and research on epidemiological, behavioral, and effectiveness trends in STI / HIV / AIDS.

The Project has provided Management with the development of actions that contribute to analyzing the dynamics of the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the state and the strengthening of Management's governance capacity.The production and systematization of technical-scientific information have become an essential strategy for reaching health professionals and contributing to public political processes.Women, including Lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals, were the population group with the most data produced. Consequently, new strategies of action and professional training.Last year, a georeferenced app for the most vulnerable young population on HIV prevention and other STIs was developed. Thus, the young population can investigate their vulnerability and access the places with the most comfortable access to prevention, PREP, and PEP testing inputs. The App is called Sem Caô and is available for Android and IOS phones.Currently, the HIV epidemic affects more young people, so the focus of the project's actions was aimed at young people. Both research, interventions, and strategies considered young people, men who have sex with men and women in situations of social vulnerability and difficulty accessing education and health services.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

These materials—comprising a brochure, a print-ready poster, and a video—were created in collaboration with the Basic Life Skills Education Unit of the Ministry of Education.  The materials raise awareness about the importance of providing young people with accurate, age-appropriate information, which is essential for their development of skills in decision-making, communication, and critical thinking. Furthermore, the materials emphasize the vital role of parents and care givers as trusted figures with whom children can engage when faced with questions about their bodies, relationships, and values. Empowering parents to act as accessible, reliable resources is crucial to fostering a supportive environment for young people, ensuring their overall health, well-being, and survival. The CSE in school materials follow international standards. Through its efforts, UNFPA contributes significantly to the goals outlined in the National Education Policy 2024-2031, particularly in the integration of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) into the curricula of basic education, high schools, and vocational schools across Suriname.  see: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZHPpM-SmUrzu4MOYkLTo5_4Lv0-ezes3","10000","10000","0","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In addition, videos in the areas such as Math, Physics and Chemistry that are produced by women were prioritized, when possible. Still, it has been identified that few relevant female teachers produce and disseminate videos in these areas.Given their great potential to be accessible anytime and anywhere, educational resources can be an important inclusion tool, enabling individuals from disadvantaged groups to have access to education. In addition to allowing equal access to quality educational resources among boys and girls, in the methodology to restructure the YouTube Edu channel, issues such as the balanced number of videos produced by men and women has been considered. We highlight that in addition to the playlists related to school subjects, the new YouTube Edu will have two new playlists dedicated to gender equality: a playlist dedicated to SDG 5, with videos about discrimination, infant and maternal mortality, sexual and reproductive rights, female leadership and empowerment, gender-based violence etc; and a more general playlist on gender equality, which will be placed in the general education topics playlists section. Such playlists have the potential to aware consciousness regarding gender equality in Brazil. The project also contributes to the global priority of Africa, since the selected videos, all in Portuguese language, can also be accessed by African Portuguese-speaking countries","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Through resource mobilization and capacity building at the 9th Annual Statisticians Meeting, UNICEF has supported the professional development of Ministry of Education statisticians to enhance data-driven education policy and programming across member states. UNICEF’s collaboration with the OECS has made significant progress in improving educational and social outcomes for youth across the region. Through targeted initiatives, both adults and youth have contributed to enhancing education and youth development programmes. These efforts have positively impacted thousands of children and youth, creating greater learning opportunities. In total, 156 adults and 494 children/youth participated in programmes benefiting over 125,000 young people, primarily in pre-primary, primary, and secondary education. In 2024, UNICEF and the OECS Council of Ministers organized key events to advance youth development and education. The OECS Youth and Sports meeting in March engaged 300 participants, focusing on youth development. The September education meeting brought together 43 adults and 10 youth, while the Digital Curriculum Hackathon involved 17 adults and seven youth, focusing on digital education. The OECS Implementation Meeting in April focused on education policy, involving 58 adults. These events shaped educational policies, promoted youth engagement, and improved the overall learning experience in the OECS. Through the Education Council of Ministers, all nine countries have collectively and individually made a Commitment to Action for Foundational Learning. Following the 2022 Transforming Education Summit and study in seven Caribbean islands, UNICEF conducted research, consultation, and validation of the Commitment to Action for Transforming Education, in the United Kingdom Overseas Territories, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands. The research received input from a wide range of stakeholders, including premiers, governors, and education ministers, demonstrating strong political commitment to transforming education in these territories. Addressing the multifaceted challenges of reimagining education in the UKOTs requires a coordinated approach that balances regional needs with global trends. Adapting the education system is essential to equip students with skills for the future, ensuring education remains relevant and transformative. In Trinidad and Tobago, UNICEF has worked to improve the inclusivity of education for Venezuelan migrant children. A 2024 amendment to the immigration regulations allows children under 18, registered under the 2019 Migrant Registration Framework, to attend national schools. As chair of the Education Working Group, UNICEF has collaborated with the Ministry of Education to develop a system for registering these children. To date, 60 children have been enrolled in 22 schools. UNICEF continues to support the Ministry in addressing the needs of both migrant and local children. Additionally, UNICEF has partnered with eight community-based organizations running 18 child-friendly spaces, offering informal education and services to migrant children. Despite these efforts, access to formal education remains hindered by the legislative framework. UNICEF continues advocating for the inclusion of all migrant and refugee children. Through ongoing advocacy and capacity-building, UNICEF champions cultural acceptance and broader inclusion.  Promoting Accessibility. UNICEF and the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education provided eye screenings to facilitate glasses for approximately 600 children in need. By December 2024, 328 of over 1,200 students received glasses, improving their engagement in learning. Progress was also made in the Caribbean Safe School Initiative across eight participating states. Six countries - Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Barbados, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - approved the CSSI policy, and a monitoring tool was developed. A cost-cutting proposal for the Secretariat, supported by CDEMA, was completed, and discussions for further funding are ongoing. Additionally, 346 educators were trained in disaster risk management, impacting over 5,000 students and 3,950 parents. The migration of over 9,000 curriculum-based digital content items to ministry of education platforms in Barbados, Dominica, Grenada and Turks and Caicos Islands is progressing, with completion expected by April 2025. Capacity-building programmes for teachers in Barbados will be completed by March 2025, with a detailed support programme set for early 2025. The integration of technology, including AI and emerging technologies, is reshaping global education, making it essential for the UKOTs to update their educational offerings. Strategic investments in innovation are necessary to build a resilient education system that empowers youth, enhances global competitiveness, and drives sustainable development. The GIGA initiative has improved education in the Eastern Caribbean by enhancing school connectivity and resilience. It has developed the Children’s Climate Risk Index-Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM) and helped ministries address connectivity gaps. Workshops for senior officials from eight governments have focused on managing connectivity and financing, ensuring sustainable digital inclusion. Through these efforts, GIGA is working to provide equitable access to quality online resources and meaningful connectivity for students across the region.

During 2022 UNHCR continued its community-based ESL classes for Waroe and Spanish speaking out of school children in different indigenous communities of Region 1. The community-based classes aim at providing children with the most basic skills in preparation for enrollment in formal schooling, while awaiting space to become available. The project is run through direct implementation by UNHCR in coordination with the Toushous and community leaders and provides also employment opportunities within the communities through the UNV Programme. A total of 7 UN Community Volunteers were employed and some 147 indigenous out of school children enrolled. In addition, UNHCR established a partnership agreement with the Ministry of Education to provide after school ESL classes to Venezuelan and Guyanese returnee children enrolled in the formal education system. In regions 1, 3 and 7, a total of 472 children attended the after-school classes, while capacity strengthening training in ESL has been delivered to teachers from 14 schools. UNHCR considers education as a core right, thus it contributed to strengthen the capacity of schools and the Ministry of Education. Throughout 2022, UNHCR procured and donated various types of equipment and school supplies. All children enrolled in the ESL after-school classes received learning materials, and schools were equipped with tablets and school furniture. In addition, UNHCR supported the newly established Migrant Support and Risk Management Unit of the MoE with various office supplies. UNHCR also supported the Ministry with the development of the first ESL Curriculum and Diagnostic Assessment tools in Guyana.

One of the most notable highlights of this project is the pioneering spirit of the city of São Paulo in integrating the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the municipal education curriculum. This alignment not only strengthens the relevance of the content taught, but also engages students in essential global issues, preparing them to be conscious and active citizens in promoting a sustainable future.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
