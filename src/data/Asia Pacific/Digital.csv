Through data assessment exercises conducted by IOM Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Regional Office of Asia and the Pacific (ROAP), several key challenges to applying an evidence-based approach to migration and mainstreaming in the country have been identified, including dispersion of policymaking actors across various government structures, limited use of migration-related statistics by government actors, limited awareness on migration governance, limited awareness on migration's impact on development and limited use of innovative sources of migration relevant data. To address these gaps there exists a need for a disaggregated and interconnected migration data to serve as an evidence base, for effective migration governance. Therefore, the project aims to work closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment and other relevant ministries to develop an integrated migration data platform to assist in development and/ or revision of migration policy instruments in the country.

This was achieved by ensuring that the non-measles non-rubella (NMNR) discard rate remained above 2 in every state and district across the country. Impressively, India attained an NMNR rate of more than six per 100,000 population, surpassing the global standard of 2. In 2024, 17,885 measles cases were detected, including lab-confirmed, epidemiologically linked, and clinically compatible cases. MoHFW, with WHO's support, investigated 979 suspected measles outbreaks, detecting 345 lab-confirmed outbreaks, and initiating appropriate public health response measures. Additionally, 16 lab-confirmed rubella outbreaks were detected in 2024, with corresponding public health responses promptly implemented.DPT SurveillanceWHO's support to MoHFW for DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus) surveillance resulted in the reporting of 5630 suspected diphtheria cases, with 1198 lab-confirmed cases identified. Additionally, 2374 suspected pertussis cases were reported, with 226 lab-confirmed cases and 70 cases of neonatal tetanus were reported. These efforts underscore WHO's commitment to strengthening disease surveillance and response mechanisms.Strengthening laboratory network for surveillanceWHO provides technical support to the MOHFW for capacity building and quality assurance of the VPD laboratory network. This network comprises 10 polio, 28 MR, and 21 diphtheria-pertussis laboratories. The network of polio laboratories in India meets the global performance standards and tests nearly 60,000 stool specimens collected under AFP and iVDPV surveillance and nearly 1800 samples collected under environmental surveillance.The MR laboratories processed more than 110,000 serology samples. In addition to supporting their annual accreditation, WHO organized training on real-time RT PCR and sequence editing and analysis in 2023- 2024. Diphtheria-pertussis laboratories are also being strengthened for testing samples collected under sentinel typhoid fever surveillance.Concurrent MonitoringIn 2024, WHO monitored the immunization status of more than 5.3 million children under the age of five. This extensive monitoring effort provided critical evidence to support and enhance routine immunization programs across the country.Polio/Measles and Rubella (MR) Seroprevalence Study, India, 2024WHO supported MoHFW in conducting seroprevalence studies for polio, measles, and rubella in four states: Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. The studies covered 20 districts within these states and involved collecting 1500 blood samples between April and September 2024. WHO's key contributions included coordinating with stakeholders, building the capacity of surveyors and implementers, and ensuring the smooth execution of the study.Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) Post validation assessmentIn July 2024, WHO supported MoHFW in conducting post-validation assessments for MNTE in three states, namely Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. WHO's involvement spanned planning, coordination, implementation, and report writing. The country continued to maintain its MNTE validation status, ensuring continued protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus.iVDPV SurveillanceWHO played a crucial role in iVDPV (immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus) surveillance in 2024. Twenty-one sentinel sites were identified, and training was conducted with WHO's support. This effort led to the reporting of 200 primary immunodeficiency (PID) cases and the isolation of two cases of iVDPV3, highlighting the importance of vigilant surveillance in preventing polio outbreaksCity-based typhoid fever surveillanceWHO will support MoHFW in rolling out city-based, laboratory-supported surveillance in 30 cities across India in 2024-2025, marking a significant leap in surveillance and public health preparedness for typhoid. WHO supported the development of a surveillance protocol, guideline, and training package; assessment of laboratories and sentinel sites; and capacity building through workshops in six cities in 2024. Typhoid fever surveillance became operational in Ahmedabad and Indore by September 2024, and the data generated provides insights into disease epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns among lab-confirmed cases.Use of Digital TechnologiesFacilitated digitization of 94% immunization microplans in 143 districts undertaking Zero Dose Implementation Plan.WHO NPSN supported the digitalization of microplans in 4101 of 4272 (96%) Planning units in 143 ZIP Districts.WHO Supported the enhancement and successful integration of SAFE-VAC, the web-based application for reporting and recording AEFI, with the U WIN application.Communicable diseases:1.

These key focus areas align with the global agenda, aiming to support digital learning in the digital age. UNICEF collaborated with national and sub-national governments, private sector, and international partners, focusing three key areas—content, capacity, and connectivity. These key focus areas align with the global agenda, aiming to support digital learning in the digital age.UNICEF has persistently expanded digital learning content in the primary education sector, developing a total of 20 new interactive contents available to the public on Medle.mn. Approximately 80,000 users accessed these interactive contents on Medle.mn, totaling 350,000 engagements. Usability test was conducted involving 19 primary-level students from three schools, namely #48, #116, and #29. This evaluation, inclusive of students with vision and hearing impairments, aimed to assess real-life usability and identify potential issues. Consequently, the 20 interactive contents underwent refinement to address interface and functionality concerns, subsequently being re-published on Medle.mn for an optimized user experience. To maximize outreach and utilization of interactive contents, UNICEF implemented targeted promotional activities. These activities included the distribution of “How to access interactive contents” guide brochures, a series of educational module videos, public LED display advertisements, and strategic engagement on social media platforms. Additionally, UNICEF formulated a comprehensive blueprint for the conceptual ""Digital Adventure learner-centric platform,"" laying the groundwork for future developmental endeavors.Acknowledging the unique needs of remote herder families, UNICEF procured custom audio players to facilitate the delivery of audio content to 6,736 children. This initiative has successfully covered all 21 provinces, ensuring equitable access to educational resources for children in remote areas.Moreover, UNICEF collaborated with Mobicom Corporation for the ""Smart Education 3"" initiative, aimed at establishing fully-equipped digital classrooms. The initiative includes the provision of essential equipment such as 30 Chromebooks, 10 VR Oculus Quest devices, smartboards, and internet connectivity at eight selected schools (two in Ulaanbaatar and eight in the provinces). UNICEF conducted targeted capacity-building training sessions for teachers, focusing on improving ICT and digital literacy skills, adopting a learner-based approach to address learning loss, and utilizing digital interactive contents in teaching and learning. A total of 1076 teachers directly benefited from these trainings, indirectly impacting 5,944 primary education students.With UNICEF’s initiative Giga’s support and collaboration with Information Technology Center of Education (ITCE), a significant progress has been made in the deployment of the Daily Check App, with 677 schools (80% of all schools) successfully installing the app and transmitting internet connectivity data. ITCE implemented a Real-Time Monitoring system, leveraging LibreNMS, to capture essential metrics on schools' bandwidth utilization, uptime, and related aspects. This system serves as a vital tool for identifying and addressing issues impeding quality connections within schools.Lessons learned: Insufficient user-friendliness in the platform poses a barrier to learners' access to educational content. Elevating the user experience and interface of the platform emerges as a top priority, as a well-designed, engaging, and attractive platform plays a pivotal role in nurturing students' ongoing enthusiasm for learning. In addition to the government partner, collaboration with private sectors (e.g., edtech startups) could be explored for cultivating innovative solutions that can effectively address the challenge of creating an accessible and enriching educational environment.UNICEF is actively enriching the digital content library for children, introducing alternative learning solutions, and expanding efforts to reach more children in need of education. A significant focus is placed on capacity-building training for teachers, aligning these endeavors with the Ministry of Education's vision, the new education law, and its implementation.UNICEF collaborates closely with the Ministry of Education and Science, including its key agencies such as the General Authority for Education, Information Technology Center of Education, and the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications. UNICEF has reinforced its partnerships with private sector entities, notably Mobicom Corporation and Marchaakhai LLC, aiming to introduce and implement innovative digital solutions. This strategic collaboration reflects UNICEF's commitment to leveraging diverse partnerships to drive forward progressive initiatives and ensure the successful integration of cutting-edge digital solutions in the education sector.","410819","410819","","","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Preliminary feedback indicates a positive change in challenging harmful gender norms, as seen in the involvement of girls in sports. UNICEF partnered with the MoE and an Information Communication Technology agency to establish the Teacher Digital Competency Curriculum (TDCC) framework, under which 714 master trainers were trained and 415 certified with an internationally recognised professional development certification. The roll out plan for teacher capacity development is currently under discussion. Additionally, to address teacher shortages in the Northern Province, in partnership with KOICA, UNICEF piloted an innovative ‘twin classrooms’ concept, which is a collaborative teaching and learning programme between rural and expert teachers in math and language, between 20 schools transmitting lessons and 20 schools receiving lessons. To ensure the qualitg of digital content developed for education, a digital content accreditation framework was developed in consultation with the MOE and NIE.

It aimed to lay the foundation of knowledge which will help Indonesia to critically think about how best to design and implement a CDR system that would best suit their country’s needs. A grounding in the concept of CDR systems, together with a comparative analysis of the implementation of these systems in various jurisdictions, helped BPKN officers to draw out the lessons learnt from CDR in different contexts and identify best practices.
Outcome of the training workshop: Better understanding of needs, concerns, best practices and policy options for beneficiary countries implementing online dispute resolution for consumers, strengthened capacities on enhancing business-to-consumer e-commerce, in particular on dispute resolution for consumers, considering lessons learnt.
19 participants from BPKN attended the three-day virtual course and actively participated in the discussions. 68,75 per cent of attendees mentioned in the satisfaction survey that they “Strongly agree” with the following phrase: The training will help me to critically think about how best to design and implement a CDR system that would best suit my country’s needs.

Under the project technical assistance component, we are collecting information on national legal frameworks, interests and concerns regarding consumer dispute resolution and redress in Indonesia for a report on national frameworks for consumer dispute resolution and redress,
Outcome: New laws and policies implemented, and capacities reinforced to allow implementation of online dispute resolution for consumers, consensus emerges on implementation of such dispute resolution including for cross-border cases.
This is a medium-term outcome that would be evaluated at the end of the Project in 2023. 
Indicator of progress: Indonesian national legal frameworks reviewed
The report is under the last stage of finalization. The validation workshop will take place in February 2022.

As part of the DODR project’s annual plan of activities, UNCTAD organized the second training workshop on consumer dispute resolution for officers in charge of consumer protection  from 22 to 24 March 2022.[2] The three-day online event aimed to analyze the wide range of experiences on technologies applied to consumer online dispute resolution, their potentialities and advantages. The workshop helped the countries’ officers  draw out a bigger picture of the present landscape of emerging technologies, their uses in consumer dispute resolution, and the challenges and best practices. More than 100 officers participated, 86 per cent of whom mentioned that the training workshop would facilitate their daily tasks. As a result, UNCTAD and BPKN are defining the technical requirements for the development of a consumer complaint handling and dispute resolution software to facilitate consumer’s access to justice.During this reporting period, UNCTAD finalized a report on the “National framework for consumer complaints handling and dispute resolution in Indonesia”[3]. The findings were discussed at the national level during a webinar on 24 October 2022[4] to foster cooperation bridges among government authorities.

The project surpassed its target of outreach to 5,000 women, with 7,428 registering on the WeLearn online platform and more than 2400 users have completed learning the modules, available at: welearn.unwomen.org. On and offline WeLearn training and coaching activities reached 4,020 women across Indonesia, receiving positive feedback and demonstrating enhanced capacities among trainees based on pre- and post-training surveys. Through the WeLearn trainings, women entrepreneurs increased their financial management skills for their businesses in three critical areas: (1) separating business and household bookkeeping; (2) calculating the cost of the goods sold; and (3) producing simple financial reports. In addition, based on the business checkup from the WeLearn training and coaching participants, these respondents acknowledged benefiting from WeLearn training with skills ranging from developing a business plan, financial management, digital marketing, business operations, and business legalities. During the project implementation, UN Women developed partnerships and worked in collaboration with government organizations, the private sector and donor-funded entrepreneurship programs to reach wider groups of women entrepreneurs for capacity buildings, build WeLearn awareness, and socialization of financial access for women entrepreneurs. Key challenges included limited physical mobility due to the COVID-19, which impacted the approach to capacity building activities. Because many project activities were conducted online and through various digital platforms, the project was not able to reach out to women entrepreneurs who did not have access to internet and digital technology.

As a result, parliamentarians committed to prioritizing reforms in three critical areas: the establishment of a Human Rights Commission, amendments to property and inheritance laws, and provisions for nursing, breastfeeding, and daycare facilities for working women. These reforms are expected to strengthen institutional frameworks and create an enabling environment for women’s rights and participation across various sectors.The Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) successfully led to the substantial integration of WEPs in the development of selection criteria for awarding/acknowledging private companies that were implementing family friendly policies and practices as part of the implementation of the Prime Minister Women Empowerment Package 2024.","120000","120000","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Despite the government’s efforts to provide diverse learning modalities (via TV, radio, e-learning, social media and printed material), children experienced significant learning loss, further compounded by the extended teacher strike in July.  UNICEF, in consultation with the Provincial Departments of Education, and building on experiences with learning recovery and continuity programmes in Uva, Central and Eastern provinces, compiled and recommended an approach to reduce learning losses , which was disseminated during a national level dialogue convened by the Ministry of Education (MoE). This led to joint development of guidelines, which were shared with all nine provinces for their planning and implementation of learning continuity programmes. UNICEF also extended financial support to the remaining six provinces to produce printed/digital material, reaching 834,733 primary students. Findings from the UNICEF-supported national survey to assess access to and effectiveness of the various remote learning modalities adopted in primary education during the prolonged school closure, was presented at multiple forums and informed the formulation of a home-based learning programme, and fed into ongoing education reforms of the MoE.","","","","UNICEF: As technology for learning increasingly gained importance, UNICEF proactively engaged relevant stakeholders on GIGA and Reimagine Education – global partners and initiatives on online learning. This led to a partnership with ICTA (apex ICT Agency of the Government) and the State Ministry of Education Reforms to build institutional capacity on blended learning and online pedagogy and assessment, with implementation commencing in 2022. UNICEF also contributed to a dialogue on developing a national ICT education policy and will continue to provide technical expertise as things progress. In 2022 the partnership with the Ministry of Education (MoE) and ICTA (apex ICT Agency of the Government) in building the institutional capacity of teachers on blended learning and online pedagogy saw the completion of a national assessment of teacher ICT capacity, curriculum framework and the finalization of Level 1 (Basic level) out of three levels of modules. In support of increasing access to technology for education, the signing of the MOU with the not for profit - DP Education, to provide 100 rural schools access to digital education by means of a SMART Classroom set up inclusive of hardware, software, internet connectivity, teacher capacity and monitoring took place. The operationalization of the action plan kick started this year and will continue into 2023. ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

While UNESCO overall coordinated and supported Ministry of Education in the preparation of report and compendium of Education policies and programmes in G 20 countries, UNICEF drafted and lead the chapter on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy(FLN). UNICEF as the knowledge partner for  the Ministry of Education for G20 on foundational learning, leveraged to advocate for increased global focus on the importance foundational literacy and numeracy and highlighted the global and Indian best experience through representation and presentations in all the four education working group meetings, exhibitions and seminars. UNICEF supported NITI in development of education sector module including the preparation of outline and overall framework, the base presentation to facilitate roll out of Aspirational Blocks Programme led by NITI .   UNICEF’s supported in preparation of 17 state equity profiles and shared with state governments to strengthen evidence based planning of education sector( Samagra Shiksha) with a improved focus on education interventions for children of disadvantaged/vulnerable/marginalized communities. Learning assessment data coupled with gender and equity analysis of key educational indicators enhanced state education functionaries’ capacities in the use of data and evidence in the state education sector planning process and in ensuring targeted interventions for the children of disadvantaged and vulnerable communities including children with disabilities for improved access and learning. UNICEFs technical support to Ministry of Education and National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in the dissemination of findings of FLS and NAS 2021 has enhanced states’ understanding of evidence on student learning at state and district level.Through a joint roundtable with National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on the implementation of the 2021 national assessment survey (NAS) with national stakeholders, lessons learnt discussed to increased understanding for improved implementation for the next NAS in 2024.  Eight states have initiated for establishing early warning systems (EWS) for identifying children at risk of dropping out from schools. For example, in Uttar Pradesh, 8,213 government schools in four districts identified children at risk and kept them in school. Gujarat has developed a model by using AI that predicts students at risk of dropping.  UNICEF technical support to state governments in the developments of guidance documents, modules, standard operating procedures, and courses led to 12 states enhanced implementing of comprehensive school safety programme through 101,706 (40% female) trained education functionaries and integrating elements of climate change specifically in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu  Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal","1500000","1289877","1289877","UNICEF delivered significant results for children in education, with a focus on equity, inclusivity, and innovation. Through a comprehensive ""Status of School Education"" report analyzing 160 education indicators across state and national levels, UNICEF enabled evidence-based planning at state level. These reports which focused on gender and equity analysis of key educational indicators enhanced state education functionaries’ capacities in the use of data and evidence in preparation of evidence-based state education sector plans and in ensuring targeted interventions for the children of disadvantaged and vulnerable communities including children with disabilities for improved access and learning. Developed in Power BI, the report highlights issue of low access, retention and learning proficiency especially at secondary level and among marginalized groups together shortage of teachers in some states. These efforts ensured targeted interventions for marginalized groups, including children with disabilities and leveraged USD 213 million in domestic financing  UNICEFs continued technical support to development of guidance documents and training of education functionaries led to 12 states effectively implementing comprehensive school safety programme (CSSP) and capacity of 121,057 education functionaries was strengthened to integrate elements of climate change into CSSP and  a national teacher training module on climate change is being finalized by NCERT with UNICEF support.    UNICEF supported state governments to develop digital learning strategies or roadmaps. In Assam, a comprehensive digital learning strategy was initiated in partnership with SmSA and relevant departments. Jammu  Kashmir revised its 'Roadmap on Digital Transformation of Education,' addressing EdTech integration and cybersecurity. Kerala's model of early IT adoption in education serves as a benchmark for others. As a result of this work, UNICEF India has developed a national strategy on digital learning for the next five years and convened a multistakeholder national consultation governments, civil society, UN agencies, and the private sector to receive feedback on the strategy and to drive the agenda on digital pedagogy and the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence in education.

The objectives of this guideline are to improve the quality, effectiveness, and adaptability of laws, making the legislative process more inclusive and proactive.The server procurement was revised to optimize the Citizen Engagement Platform, reflecting the preference to host the platform on GovTech servers. This enabled the successful execution of four capacity development workshops with both the National Assembly and National Council:1. A workshop on Capacity Development on the platform was attended by 11 participants (6 males, 5 females), equipping them with the necessary skills to effectively use the platform.2. A sensitization session was conducted for the members of the National Council on the Platform, with 20 participants (18 males, 2 females) gaining a deeper understanding of the platform’s capabilities.3. A workshop on international human rights conventions was held, providing 19 Secretariat participants (10 males, 9 females) and 20 Members of Parliament (18 males, 2 females) with a comprehensive understanding of these conventions and their implications.4. A workshop on Anticipatory Governance and Foresight was attended by 16 Members of Parliament from the National Council (14 males, 2 females) and 24 officials (10 males, 14 females) from both the NC and NA Secretariats, fostering forward-thinking governance strategies.In addition, a conversation supporting consultations on the UNCRPD was conducted (one through the platform and another with OPDs), resulting in a report that was submitted to both houses to aid in the deliberation on the Convention. This collaborative effort led to the lifting of the reservation on Article 9 of the UNCRPD prior to its ratification, demonstrating the tangible impact of these capacity development initiatives.intervention in legal aid reached 53 indigent individuals, enhancing inclusivity and access to justice. ﻿30 of Bhutan’s commonly used and in-demand public services were onboarded onto the Service Evaluation Tool.

Government counterparts will co-lead the undertaking of a Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA), a tool comprised of a nationwide survey that ensures a consultative and gender sensitive approach is followed to map Niue’s digital strengths and weaknesses across the five pillars of UNDP’s digital transformation framework, namely government, infrastructure, regulation, business and people.

This data is used to inform planning and decision-making for food security. In 2022, with WFP support, the Ministry of Social Affairs’ Disaster Mitigation Information System (e-SIMBA) was strengthened by the integration of real-time climate risk data. e-SIMBA was further enhanced by linkages with the Ministry’s Disaster Resilient Communities (KSB), Social Barn (Lumbung Sosial), and community-based disaster preparedness and volunteer (TAGANA) programmes into e-SIMBA, as well as the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency’s early warning systems. These linkages provide information that can be used to strengthen Government-led disaster preparedness and response. This builds on the work initiated under the UN Joint Sustainable Development Goal Fund and advances anticipatory action and adaptive social protection in Indonesia and within ASEAN. WFP further worked towards enhancing utilization of real-time climate risk data through partnership with the Ministry of National Development Planning, specifically the Ministry’s Food and Agriculture Directorate. The new real-time climate risk data complements the Ministry’s own static data and allows for more robust analysis to inform Government programme planning.

Efforts were made to secure timely fund utilization and assets management, inception of MICS7, strategic engagement with public and private sectors through advocacy and fundraising events, increased exposure to traditional and social media for advocacy and raising awareness and UNICEF bland. Cross-cutting programming, adolescent engagement, SBC and humanitarian, increased UNICEF visibility among general public and UNICEF leading role in natural disaster responses throughout the year.The UNICEF branding study presented opportunities to engage individual giving for expanded fundraising effort. As part, UNICEF Mongolia successfully managed the first-ever Gala event in November, which encouraged support from the private sector and individuals, creating friends of UNICEF from existing and new partners. This is also an opportunity to increase UNICEF branding in Mongolia which was reported to be lower than expected.Despite of the significantly increased effort on PSEA, it seems a challenge for the government institutions, including accademia, to complete all the assessment. UNICEF Mongolia continues discussing and exploring the way to establish strong partnerships to support evidence-based programming. Following the internal audit report, completed in 2022, UNICEF continues its efforts in quality assurance and monitoring, especially end-user monitoring. While HACT activities are completed in time, the office strategize how to effectively and efficiently ensure its interventions to bring results for children. One of the agreed actions is to utilize the third-party for HACT spot checks to secure the objectivity. In 2023, the office accelerated its improved knowledge management through the Knowledge Management Task Force, led by Deputy Representative Programme. While in progress, an office-wide knowledge management strategy is under development. Effective utilization of collaboration site and ICON are also under discussion. It is to enhance cohesive use of the existing resources, further collaboration among programmes and operations, and visibility of UNICEF Mongolia. Lessons learned and innovations: Learning from the external relations, there is a clear demand to provide targeted communication and engagement to further strengthen UNICEF branding and awareness among the general public. Initiatives like Gala event and Children's Day celebration can serve as great entry points. Better visibiliy and cohesive branding efforts are to be strategized and enforced. UNICEF is exploring more opportunities to utilize digital technologies for partnerships and fundraising in 2024.The roll-out of new tools, including ezHACT 2.0, were successfully done; however, it took some time to get familialized, process, and support partners. With RO support, the office continues providing capacity building opportunities for its maximum use.As Mongolia experiences multiple natural disaster related humanitarian situations, UNICEF supported the Government of Mongolia as well as the National Emergency Management Agency, providing technical support and necessary equipments, supplies, medications and human resources. Through the collaboration, the lack of coordination among ministries and government entities as well as the lack of capacity were identified. With added capacity within UNICEF in 2023, it enhances efforts in building overall capacity in rapid responses and accurate data collection among the government entities in 2024.As MICS 7 is expected to be completed by mid-2024, UNICEF Mongolia is strategizing how to effectively use the data and its findings. A distribution plan, not only dissemination workshops but also communication tools, is under development for improved planning and budget allocation in partnership with relevant government entities.  Partnerships: UNICEF Mongolia contineus working with relevant ministries, provincial and sub-provincial government offices, civil society organizations, academia and communities. While the office has already made significant effort for meaningful partnership with young people, it makes sure to involve children, adolescent and young people in key milestone of its operation and programming. As a member of UNCT Mongolia, UNICEF takes an active role in collaborating with other UN agencies as well as the Resident Coordinator's Office. Implementation of the UNSDCF 2023-2027 has bagun, and joint effort was further focused through development of joint projects and joint proposals, especially with UNFPA, UNDP, UNFAO, ILO and WHO.

A total of 5 training sessions were conducted in which 185 officials were trained. Presently data is being collected for writing of the report by MoHR.                                                                                                                                       As an ongoing initiative to strengthen gender data regime in Pakistan UN Women continued its support to the National Commission on the Status of Women for strengthening the National Gender Data Portal (NGDP). During the period trainings on understanding the indicator matrix (143 quantitively indicators) and reporting were held at provincial level for 49 concerned departments including all four Provincial Bureaus of Statistics.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)UNODC upgraded the Database Management Information System (DBMIS), creating a digital interface that automates processes and visualizes situational analysis through a dashboard. This system fosters connectivity among key rule of law stakeholders, promoting efficient collaboration among various entities involved in the justice system.UNODC is actively involved in the implementation of the Prison Management Information System (PMIS) in KP and Balochistan, with installations in 38 prisons in KP and 13 prisons in Balochistan. In this regard, 219 prison officials including 20 females were trained on PMIS. Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance collaboration between the Punjab Prosecution Department and Punjab Prisons Department, focusing on improving the Case Flow Management System (CFMS) and integrating it with PMIS. Moreover, the Case Management and Monitoring System (CMMS) has been initiated, further enhancing the digital infrastructure for efficient data governance.UNODC also conducted a targeted training workshop for 16 police staff members, providing them with essential skills to effectively utilize the specialized software implemented in the Smart Police Stations and Police Khidmat Markaz.Moreover, UNODC initiated the process of establishing four eLearning centres in each Provincial Counter Terrorism Department across Pakistan and the localisation of 10 eLearning modules on CT and gender-related subjects. 106 officials of the FIA including 70 constables, 28 FIA Inspectors and 8 Assistant Directors completed various online eLearning courses relevant to their agency’s mandate.","16476412","5864430","4037088","UN Women will start Interventions in the next reporting year.UNODC: Justice sector institutions now operate with greater efficiency and coordination due to the enhanced Database Management Information System (DBMIS), which enables real-time situational analysis and automated processes. This transformation has strengthened inter-agency collaboration, ensuring data-driven decision-making and more effective service delivery.Prison management has been modernized, with 40 prisons in KP and 13 in Balochistan now using the Prison Management Information System (PMIS). As a result, 302 prison officials (21 females) have the technical capacity to manage prison data effectively, improving record-keeping, security, and inmate management. Additionally, 71 officials (15 females) in Punjab now have the skills to integrate and manage the Case Flow Management System (CFMS) with PMIS, ensuring faster case processing and better coordination between prosecution and prison departments.Police operations have been strengthened, with 37 officers (5 females) from Smart Police Stations now proficient in using digital case management systems, leading to greater efficiency in policing and crime data management.The judicial system has been modernized, with the establishment of six fully operational e-Courts (five in Sindh and one in Balochistan). These courts now facilitate secure and efficient remote testimonies, reducing risks for witnesses and expediting case proceedings. This advancement ensures that terrorism cases are handled more effectively, enhancing judicial transparency and compliance with international witness protection standards.Through these reforms, justice sector institutions now operate with stronger digital infrastructure, improved data management, and greater coordination, resulting in a more responsive, transparent, and technology-driven legal system.ILO is supporting National Statistics Offices to collect and analyse data to report on ILS reporting obligations including on gender indicators in the labour market like gender pay gap, measuring informal work.

ESCAP, under the project “E-Commerce Capacity Building for Women-led MSMEs in South Asia”, has undertaken a multifaceted approach towards enabling women entrepreneurs of South Asia, including India, to expand their reach and participate in local, regional, and international supply chains. This initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic has recognised the significance of e-commerce as a medium to conduct business and paved the way to be an important tool for women-led MSMEs to become part of the wider supply chain.Through the project, women entrepreneurs have access to online e-learning courses on e-commerce and digital marketing (https://unescap.wesellonline.org/elearning/), an e-commerce training portal (www.wesellonline.org) for women entrepreneurs, and a beginners manual on e-commerce and digital marketing (https://www.unescap.wesellonline.org/Ecommerce-manual/).As on 31 Dec 2022, 818 women entrepreneurs from South Asian countries have registered on Wesellonline and updated their product/service profile (352 from India). Additionally, ESCAP conducted a series of virtual and in-person workshops on e-commerce and digital marketing for women entrepreneurs that aimed to build the competence of female entrepreneurs, alongside the facilitation of networking opportunities and rreal-time support among fellow female participants through WhatsApp groups and Facebook groups(https://www.facebook.com/groups/wesellonline/about), with more than 1000 members in total, with majority Indians. A Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/wesellonline.org) has been established to encourage female entrepreneurs to share their entrepreneurial stories and products and services. In 2022, ESCAP has conducted a total of eight training, including six regional/national training and two online trainings for women entrepreneurs. For the year 2022, 703 women participants from South Asia and Africa benefitted from the training sessions, including 192 women participants from India. More than 2000 women participants from South Asia (including 572 from India) have benefited from the training sessions which integrated hands-on training on registering and linking their business to e-commerce platforms, networking opportunities, and hands-on support. These workshops also acted as a regional networking platform where women entrepreneurs showcase their products and services, thereby helping create regional networks.This initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic recognized the significance of e-commerce as a medium to conduct business and paved the way to be an important tool for women-led MSMEs to expand their businesses. The project shall have a positive long-term impact on the empowerment of women and has been presented at various international forums, including the WTO Informal Working Group on Trade and Gender ( 16 July 2021), at the Commonwealth Secretariat at the Launch of e-learning course and Panel discussion on digital infrastructure and digital divide by the Commonwealth Connectivity Agenda (21 September 2021), shortlisted as one of the ESCAP “Good Practices in South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Sustainable Development” and also featured as success stories in ESCAP publication Technical Cooperation Highlights 2020/21 .Under the Second Chance Education Program supported by UN Women, a total number of enterprises set up between January to December 2022 were: 443 women participated in off farm individual enterprises while 358 women from 23 groups participated in off farm group enterprises.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The original sub-output (SOU 7) aimed to enhance the knowledge and mechanisms of state and non-state actors to promote gender equality and integrate gender responsiveness at the national and local levels. The allocated resources for 2022 were $60,000, but only $20,000 was available, and the expenditure was $56,426. To address this inconsistency, the available resource amount was adjusted to $56,426.

The second sub-output (SOU 11) focused on the Royal Thai Government (RTG) acquiring knowledge on gender-responsive approaches to prioritize gender equality and women's empowerment in budgeting and procurement at the local and national levels. The allocated resources for 2022 were $10,000, with $5,000 available and $2,000 expended.

Now, these two sub-outputs have been integrated into a revised sub-output (Revised SOU 7). The revised statement emphasizes that state and non-state actors have increased their knowledge and mechanisms to advance gender equality and integrate gender responsiveness at the national and local levels. Additionally, it includes a specific focus on gender-responsive budgeting as a means to promote the prioritization of gender equality and women's empowerment.


The original sub-output statement (SOU 7): State and non-state actors have increased knowledges and mechanisms to advance and localize gender equality and women's empowerment  and to integrate/mainstream gender-responsive approach in their policy or operational framework at national and local level
The original sub-output statement (SOU 11): The Royal Thai Government (RTG) gain the knowledge on gender-responsive approach to advance gender responsive budgeting/procurement at local and national level to ensure that gender equality and women's empowerment are prioritized.

The integrated sub-output is now (Revised SOU 7): ""State and non-state actors have increased knowledges and mechanisms to advance and localize gender equality and to integrate/mainstream gender responsiveness at national and local level including gender-responsive budgeting to promote prioritization of gender equality and women empowerment.
