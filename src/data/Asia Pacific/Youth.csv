Around 150 religious leaders and faith-based organizations are now part of the UNICEF-supported religious leaders’ forum at the national level and in the Eastern province. Hate speech prevention program implementation commenced in seven selected divisional secretariats of the Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts during this period. Multi-stakeholder steering committees were formed in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts to coordinate and provide technical oversight on peace and social cohesion promotion in the regions. The training manual on digital literacy, digital storytelling, and social cohesion was finalized and used to train Child Rights Promotion Officers (CRPOs), Youth Service Officers (YSOs), children’s/youth club members, and religious leaders. Further, through the established religious leaders’ forum, approximately 383 community members were reached through messaging on civic responsibility, violence prevention, hate speech, and promotion of peace and social cohesion.

UNDP  - A growing interest and commitment to action from youth to better challenge misinformation and hate speech was evident with over 1500 young people participating in courses to improve their media literacy skills and volunteer to be 'Engage to Disengage Advocates'; with 27 independent community campaigns conducted to date. 

UNV - UN Volunteers mobilized through UNDP-UNV Tandem Teams programme to support countering hate speech and the spread of disinformation",788770,638770,185405,"UNICEF: UNICEF continued to support efforts to prevent the spread of hate speech. This involved close engagement with religious leaders through the establishment of three district-level religious leader forums and training of religious leaders (32) on digital literacy and the effective use of social media, reaching approximately 562 community members through messaging on civic responsibility, violence prevention, hate speech and promotion of peace and social cohesion. UNICEF expanded its work with adolescents and youth on hate speech in hotspots in five districts (Batticaloa, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Badulla and Kandy) together with 172 government officers trained as master trainers on hate speech prevention. Through them, 867 adolescents/youth (456 boys and 411 girls, including 8 children with disabilities) were engaged. NIE has initiated promoting digital citizenship skills, using the Media subject for grades 8-11. This includes the development of platforms to help students engage and promote positive narratives.UNDP - Empowerment of leadership activities for youth and cohesion has been promoted through the support provided for four CSOs (Roar Media, NCEASL, CEJ and SFCG). Over 50 selected female leaders (out of 200 applicants) across Government institutions and CSOs increased their understanding of combatting hate speech and disinformation following trainings and capacity building on exploring methods to address hate speech. The capacity building will focus on digital literacy and effective digital responses to hate speech and disinformation for selected 25 women influencers.  ",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

UNV - jointly initiated Youth Community Leadership Initiative to enhance creative and innovation space for youth leaders aspiring  to lead their communities. Through this UNV will provide technical assistance on volunteer management, volunteer management and volunteering to achieve  2030 Agenda. Youth leaders will be trained with required skills and knowledge to engage their communities through volunteer mobilization.  The approximate expenditure for 2021 received through UNDP is USD 100,000.  
WHO- •The project employs a “Healthy settings” approach; a unique concept that uses health as an entry-point for peacebuilding and community empowerment by placing youth as change agents. The Youth Parliament and the existing youth networks are used to combine aspirations of young political leaders and the needs of the community to address social inequalities and enable healthier and safer settings. The project utilizes capacity building and multi-stakeholder action towards community empowerment to drive a collective youth-led process for community-owned sustainable peacebuilding efforts.

The project developed 20 modules that were identified by NYSC together with the UN Agencies as crucial to orient and capacitate the participants on healthy settings, community development and volunteerism in-line with the overarching project objective of empowering young people in promoting health and wellbeing, volunteerism and collective action for promoting social cohesion. The modules utilize a participatory and problem-based learning approach with various hands-on activities to encourage participants to engage and interact. The programme is conducted in local languages to ensure equitable access.

The COVID 19 has impacted significantly on the capacity building trainings due to the limitations of ensuring impact on soft skill development components of the programme that relies of participant engagement to drive the peacebuilding outcomes. However, the project has incorporated an online Learning Management System as part of its design to ensure sustainability of the programme. Youth parlimantarian from Gampaha District, Malshan Perera, who attended a capacity building programme had the following to say: “To be future leaders of tomorrow who  find solutions to social issues, to think on your own, to think creatively, to identify and understand your duties as a youth, and to become a responsible citizen; the YCLI programme is the perfect opportunity to help us all. Together through this programme youth from across the nation - youth parliamentarians, university students, and youth from other organisations and CSO’s have come together to start a new journey on creating a new and better Sri Lanka. Through this programme we discussed problems that have never been addressed and found solutions to these problems together with the project team. On behalf of everyone I would like to say I am truly grateful because through this programme they have helped us become future leaders who can build a better, brighter and more beautiful nation for us all.”  ",,750000,139901,"UNDP -	 The Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs and the National Youth Services Council of Sri Lanka (NYSC) were two important national stakeholders with whom UNDP collaborated closely. In respect to the training components, NYSC is an implementing partner. Together with UNDP, have developed a learning management system to institutionalize young leadership development for youth MPs. Additionally, the Learning Management Centre for Peace Education is now progressing training activities at the provincial level with the involvement of CSOs which is expected to be reached by end of 2023.",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

These initiatives encompass alternative learning pathways, afternoon schools, and non-formal skills development components, across all provinces. Additionally, UNICEF's efforts are geared towards enhancing the quality of education at the middle level, particularly leveraging digital technologies. Thus far, 12,322 adolescents in Balochistan, KP, and Sindh have benefitted from these initiatives aimed at improving educational standards. In the context of enhancing capacities to deliver quality education and skills development to adolescents, a key document, the GenU country operating plan was finalized. In addition, an innovative, evidence-based model was developed to integrate accelerated learning, skills training, and labor market linkages, offering a hybrid solution for out of school adolescents.To expand access to learning opportunities for out of school adolescents, various interventions were implemented. This includes post-primary learning in non-formal centre reaching 11,629 adolescents (73 per cent girls); afternoon schools for 92,072 adolescents (62 per cent girls), and blended education and skills development programmes initiated in Balochistan and Punjab. Furthermore, a programme enhancing 21st century skills for 1,700 out of school adolescent girls who were Afghan refugees or in host communities, in Balochistan and KP, was launched in 2023.Digital solutions were employed to enhance the capacities for quality service delivery in middle level education. These solutions included the Sindh learning passport, supporting 4,700 girls in grades 7 and 8 to access the digital content in schools, and remote teaching on specialized subjects in middle schools benefitting 7,622 adolescents in Balochistan and KP. Young people’s engagement and skills were enhanced through innovation challenges, including the Living Indus Green Startup Challenge, Policy Research Challenge, Foresight Fellowship, ADAP Youth leadership training, GenU Incubation week, a regional adolescent workshop in Nepal, and participation in COP28. Identified challenges included the absence of sufficient data and evidence in the realm of skills development and blended education, limiting the assessment of requirements and the formulation of appropriate strategies. Moreover, the availability of trainers and facilities for various skills and trades emerged as a notable hurdle. While initiatives are currently being piloted in Balochistan and KP, these endeavors aim to provide valuable insights and adjustments before any potential scaling up. These pilot initiatives should offer crucial lessons for refinement and adaptation before broader implementation.",10850609,8647806,8647806,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

There were delays due to pandemic- hence extended the contract by 6 weeks. 	Solution /innovation - More virtual methods were used to link with Youth – which was successful. But not very sure whether the messages reached the vulnerable and marginalized youth groups who do not have easy access to virtual mode 	Lessons learnt  Good practices – this was a project lead by youth for youth. So acceptability from community youth was high. The youth leaders provided very good insights to improve Panadura YFHS center. Still the virtual awareness sessions are continuing without WHO support- moderated by Panadura Youth group. They have widened their interests of virtual discussions to music, drama, song critics and web designing. 	Strategic/policy-level communications – The success of the project has been communicated to TAC on Adolescent and young person’s health. Best practice sharing session was also conducted to inform other districts to replicate the same in enhancing linkages with health sector and youth groups 	Success Stories (beneficiary story) – Youth lead initiatives 	COVID-19-related activity (if applicable) and resulting challenges  delays in implementation, if any - already mentioned under challenges This was done in collaboration with FHB, MOH : ADIC /SRL and WHO; and UNFPA. MOH requested to support Youth friendly health centers (YFHS) and youth mobilization initiative to publicize the YFHS. UNFPA supported with infrastructure development and providing needy ICT equipment to YFHS centers while WHO supported youth mobilization component in Panadura YFHS as a pilot project. This was done under EU project. Main aim was to formulate a youth leader network and to Increase capacities among youth volunteer teams on youth health promotion  on COVID -19 prevention, Gender; tobacco,  alcohol prevention. OP-Formulated a team of 40 young volunteer leaders (58% females)and Created a youth pool of 600 + youth to work with Yowun Piyasa /Panadura and with FHB and WHO (65% females) . A series of Awareness campaigns supported - You tube drama (reached nearly 30,000 youth female&gt; male); Facebook campaign (reached 50,000+); face book quiz and a series of webinars were completed with WHO technical inputs. The virtual sessions covered – COVID-19 prevention; vaccination; Gender and GBV in youth; health promotion and on publicizing youth friendly health services. These sessions cleared myths and misconceptions among youth on COVID and on COVID vaccines and mobilized them to get vaccinatedThese sessions cleared myths and misconceptions among youth on COVID and on COVID vaccines and mobilized them to get vaccinated""",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

As we approach the 20th anniversary of the catastrophic event in 2024, it is crucial to educate and prepare the next generation, particularly high school students in Indian Ocean Member States who were born after the disaster. UNESCO is working to build the capacity of future coastal guardians through The Tsunami United Initiative. This initiative focuses on several key objectives: (1) Raise Awareness: Engage students in discussions about tsunami hazards and preparedness; (2) Connect Schools: Foster connections among schools in the Indian Ocean region; (3) Share Best Practices: Exchange effective strategies for tsunami preparedness; and (4) Encourage Collaboration: Promote cooperation among youth in the region.The initiative has successfully engaged 263 students and 117 teachers from 59 schools across 19 countries, including Indonesia, empowering youth for future resilience. Notably, students from Indonesia, including two female students from MAN 1 Banda Aceh and SMAN 1 Bayah Panggarangan Banten, participated in a live conversation with NASA astronaut Ms. Sunita Williams. This interaction sparked ideas and raised awareness about the importance of science and disaster risk reduction. In addition, 27 schools from 13 countries have participated in raising global awareness about tsunami preparedness, with two schools—MAN 1 Banda Aceh and Lab School 1 UNSYIAH in Indonesia—receiving notable recognition for their creative contributions. The Tsunami United Initiative aligns with national development plans and the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, emphasizing education, disaster risk reduction, and environmental sustainability. By fostering dialogue, sharing knowledge, and inspiring collaboration, this project aims to empower youth to effectively respond to future tsunami threats, building a resilient and united community, particularly among students in Indonesia. Through these efforts, the initiative not only prepares students for potential future disasters but also instills a sense of responsibility and community among the youth, ensuring they are equipped to contribute positively to their societies.

This initiative contributes to strengthening skill ecosystems and fostering inclusive career opportunities for diverse and underrepresented groups.UNICEF-YuWaahIn 2024, 10.12 million young people gained access to job support, apprenticeships, and work opportunities, equipping them to pursue aspirational economic pathways. Notably, 56.34% of them were young women, marking a significant step toward greater gender inclusion in the workforce. The Step Up – ‘Bano Job Ready’ program was expanded to support 1.9 million young people across India in identifying job opportunities, navigating the application process, and enhancing their employability. This was made possible through strategic partnerships with the Ministry of Labour  Employment, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Punjab Skill Development Mission, Pratham Education Foundation, and others. To further strengthen access to employment pathways, a month-long digital apprenticeship campaign was launched in collaboration with UNDP, NSDC, and the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. This initiative aimed to scale up apprenticeship opportunities by bridging critical information gaps on both the demand and supply sides. In partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), YuWaah introduced the Skill Innovation Challenge to identify and support groundbreaking solutions that enhance informal apprenticeships through digital transformation.

UN WOMEN - WEE: UN Women ICO is actively supporting the engendering of the skilling ecosystem at both national and state levels. Key contributions include recommendations to Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to strengthen gender-responsive skilling policies based on a gender analysis of 467 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) under the STRIVE project, assessing enrolment trends, dropout rates, and trade-wise disparities. UN Women also facilitated a series of gender sensitisation training sessions for Environment and Social Safety (ES) Nodal Officers from State Project Implementation Units (SPIUs), ITIs, and Occupational Hazard Safety (OHS) Nodal Officers from Industry Clusters, involving 341 participants from 30 states. Additionally, a ""Gender Sensitisation and Mainstreaming"" training for trainers and faculty was conducted with 40 officials from National Skill Training Institute (NSTI), Noida, leading to proposed expanded training across all NSTIs. Maharashtra’s Skill, Employment, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation Department (SEEID) received technical support to review and engender the Women Entrepreneurship Cell (WEC), ensuring stronger institutional support for women-led enterprises, strengthened institutional frameworks, and increased private sector engagement in gender-inclusive skilling, employment, and entrepreneurship.These efforts are part of a broader advocacy program to promote women's economic empowerment, culminating in the establishment of the Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) Working Group. This group, comprising experts from various sectors and chaired by UN Women, aims to develop strategies, facilitate collaboration, and advocate for gender equality to enhance women's participation in the labor force and entrepreneurship, especially in digital and green sectors.In August 2024, UN Women convened a policy consultation on gender-responsive Industrial Training Institutions ( ITIs) through the Working Group on Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE), engaging civil society, government, and private sector stakeholders. The dialogue addressed barriers to women’s enrolment, trade diversification, industry linkages, and institutional reforms in vocational training. The consultation resulted in policy recommendations submitted to MSDE and MWCD, aligning with the Union Budget 2024’s ITI revamp initiative. These recommendations aimed to ensure gender-responsive skilling strategies and expand women’s access to vocational learning and employment pathways.ILOSkills Innovation Challenge Call in India selected and supported four non-profit organizations to pilot innovative solutions to “Upgrade Informal Apprenticeships through Digital Transformation”.

A series of technical coordination meetings with key stakeholders, including the Center for Data and Information Development Planning (Pusdatinrenbang), led to the formulation of the portal’s architectural design. The portal’s data standard will align with metadata from Bappenas’ KOMENS and BRIN’s SPBE, ensuring consistency and usability.Development of the KH portal will continue in 2025, following the agreed architectural framework, with completion expected by mid-year. Once finalized, the portal will be socialized and made accessible to implementing partners (IPs) and relevant stakeholders, ensuring its effective utilization as a national hub for knowledge-sharing and evidence-based decision-making.",271748,271748,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-

It is initiated under the global partnership of UNICEF, Generation Unlimited, and Microsoft and Accenture on the Passport to Earning initiative, supported by a learning management system hosted on the Microsoft Community Training (MCT) Platform. A tri-partite led Young Warrior NXT initiative was launched, that will deploy large-scale life skills delivery solutions to support 14-24-year-old youth with foundational life skills. It targets 5 million youth in 2022, through 10-12 projects in partnership with life skills practitioners.  Currently, seven pilots have been shortlisted with an approximate reach of 90,000. 
Additionally, a chatbot-based solution reached 0.2 million in 2021, with 11 life-skills learning activities in 12 languages. This was done in response to adolescents missing socio-emotional learning due to online classes.The Youth Innovation Platform (UNIsolve) enabled young people to access age-appropriate content and tools on how to employ design thinking and social innovation to identify, investigate and solve for hyperlocal problems to drive social impact.   
The #YoungWarrior campaign, a youth-led movement to combat COVID-19,  triggered 6.6 million actions from 4.3 million young people. Young people have taken up actions such as capacity building, creating safe spaces and performing various tasks on U-Report such as learning how to counter misinformation or registering for vaccinations. New partners such as the Central Board for Secondary Education, University Grants Commission, and All India Council for Technical Education were brought onboard. The campaign brought together more than 1300 partners including various other Government partners. 
To engage the more marginalized constituencies of young people who do not have access to internet-enabled devices, YuWaah is also piloting low-tech and no-tech channels for engagement.
Intensive Flood Preparedness campaign reached to 1.2 million people (F 0.57, M 0.63 million) in 1400 villages, significantly improved community’s preparedness to face floods, Community Feedback Mechanism established on flood preparedness, received feedback from 5395 respondents using Kobo collect tool. The framework for building capacities of affected population on providing feedback on issues related to development and disasters is being piloted in 6 hazard prone districts of UP.

The Youth Parliament and the existing youth networks are used to combine aspirations of young political leaders and the needs of the community to address social inequalities and enable healthier and safer settings. The project utilizes capacity building and multi-stakeholder action towards community empowerment to drive a collective youth-led process for community-owned sustainable peacebuilding efforts.

The project developed 20 modules that were identified by NYSC together with the UN Agencies as crucial to orient and capacitate the participants on healthy settings, community development and volunteerism in-line with the overarching project objective of empowering young people in promoting health and wellbeing, volunteerism and collective action for promoting social cohesion. The modules utilize a participatory and problem-based learning approach with various hands-on activities to encourage participants to engage and interact. The programme is conducted in local languages to ensure equitable access.

The COVID 19 has impacted significantly on the capacity building trainings due to the limitations of ensuring impact on soft skill development components of the programme that relies of participant engagement to drive the peacebuilding outcomes. However, the project has incorporated an online Learning Management System as part of its design to ensure sustainability of the programme.

Together through this programme youth from across the nation - youth parliamentarians, university students, and youth from other organisations and CSO’s have come together to start a new journey on creating a new and better Sri Lanka. Through this programme we discussed problems that have never been addressed and found solutions to these problems together with the project team. On behalf of everyone I would like to say I am truly grateful because through this programme they have helped us become future leaders who can build a better, brighter and more beautiful nation for us all.”  ""

The aim is to provide catalytic support to the youth volunteer schemes of the Ministry (Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and National Service Scheme (NSS)) and facilitate greater youth participation and voice for peace and sustainability-oriented development programmes. Supporting the young women and men in realizing their full social, economic, and human potential, the project endeavours to help young people gain a strong sense of civic engagement and responsibility to transform their communities at large. Under the project, 1,162,621 (1.1 million) non-UN Volunteers were mobilized by National UN Volunteers in 27 States/UTs across India under a project to strengthen Government of India’s volunteering schemes - Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and National Service Scheme, implemented by UNV in collaboration with UNDP. These young volunteers were galvanized for civic actions through local level developmental initiatives around government schemes, financial  digital literacy, environment, health  sanitation, sports  wellness, women  youth empowerment, mental health, covid19 etc. More than 80 national and local level Civil Society organizations, Volunteer Involving Organizations, Governmental Departments and Agencies etc. in diverse sectors partnered with UN Volunteer for implementation of these developmental initiatives in many regions which are even hard to reach. The positive contribution of volunteerism towards the attainability of the SDGs and to Leave No One Behind has been the integral factor to empower, act and lead the youth towards nation building and self-development. Efforts led by National UN Volunteers in 27 states contributed to 33,820 young people, 44% of them women and 67% marginalized, being connected with career counselling  guidance, employment  entrepreneurship skills including 21st Century skills to create a productive workforce with focus on rural India under the Government funded project ‘Strengthening Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and National Service Scheme’, implemented by UNV in partnership with UNDP. The youth empowering activities included resume building, interviewing skills, information about various national and international scholarships, and competitive exam preparation. Trainings were also imparted on soft skills like personality development, leadership skills and design thinking. This further enhanced the UN Volunteers’ skills, increasing their self-confidence and motivation to continue with their volunteering efforts as evident from the above-mentioned data of 94.4% of UNVs reporting their personal and professional skill development. Taking forward the SDGs 6, 13 and 14, 30,465 non-UN Volunteers in 4 districts were mobilized by UN Volunteers to rejuvenate India’s sacred River, Ganges under the Namami Gange initiative, which is recognized by the United Nations as one of the top 10 World Restoration Flagship programmes, to revive the river and promote organic agriculture. The youth have been engaging in a range of activities, guided by a team of trained volunteers like Ganga Praharis, Ganga Doots, and Ganga Quest to safeguard the natural diversity of the river. These youth volunteers encourage young people and those living in the area to take steps to protect the river from pollution and help conserve it. The volunteers connected the communities on importance of water conservation and rejuvenation of water bodies by providing details on available government programs, plans, and services related to water harvesting for a cleaner Ganga. Door-to-door campaigns, street plays, and wall art were adopted as a means to generate awarenessAs a part of institutional strengthening of volunteerism, UNV provided technical and knowledge support for the drafting of the National Youth Policy (2022-32) to equip the youth and policy makers with the tools and means to understand the scale, scope, and social and economic contribution of volunteering for development.",,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-,,,,-
