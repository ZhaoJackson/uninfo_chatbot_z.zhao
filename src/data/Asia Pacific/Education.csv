The goal of using nuclear energy in the country is stated in the Mongolian law on nuclear energy, the programme to fulfill the state policy on the exploitation of radioactive minerals and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, enacted in 2009, and the list of priority directions for the development of science and technology of the Mongolian Government (2015). To fulfill the goal of these policies, a multi-purpose intensive neutron source for basic and applied research urgently needs to be build up. This conclusion has grown out of discussions at all levels, including researchers, educators and the executive office of the Nuclear Energy Commission in this field. The first crucial step for this purpose is to install a subcritical assembly for the study, education and training of bachelor, master and doctorate students, engineers and technicians in the field of nuclear energy, neutron physics and reactor physics. Requirements for improving national nuclear human resource capabilities, the implementation of a legal framework on the use of nuclear materials, and the development of a nuclear technical basis correspond to the nineteen issues for using nuclear energy recommended by the IAEA. The subcritical assembly with relatively acceptable financial expenditures is a basic nuclear installation, which will be a suitable basis for the acquirement of the research reactor and the use of nuclear energy in the future.","2020-03-13","2022-12-31","Implementation","-","-","IAEA","International Atomic Energy Agency","IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund","Nuclear Research Center, National University of Mongolia","9.1 Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure","Mongolia","Capacity Development/Technical Assistance","-","-","1 - Contributes to gender equality/women’s empowerment in a limited way","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",,"270905","270905","213036.3","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","160920","160920","137475.3","-","109985","109985","75561","-","","","","Project progressed in 2022 with the following main achievements: - Two Expert Missions were implemented (i) to support the development of a preliminary strategic plan and (ii) to support the development of the feasibility study - Two Fellowships on the installation, operation and utilization of a subcritical assembly were implemented.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The collaborative effort aimed to address AMR comprehensively across human, veterinary, and food sectors, marking the first official tripartite project of its kind. During 2023, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) directed its attention towards enhancing laboratory capacities specifically for AMR surveillance. The initial phase involved a thorough evaluation of the technical skills of lab inspectors across national laboratories spanning human, veterinary, and food domains. These labs actively participated in international proficiency testing to ensure their capabilities aligned with global standards in the critical fight against AMR. Recognizing the paramount importance of public awareness in tackling AMR, efforts extended to engaging the younger generation. Specialized awareness training sessions were conducted for school children, providing them with a simplified understanding of how AMR emerges and offering guidance on safeguarding against it. To amplify this message, collaboration with influential figures among children was fostered, activating a network capable of promoting awareness and encouraging proactive measures against the growing threat of Antimicrobial Resistance. This multifaceted approach underscored the significance of a One Health perspective in addressing AMR, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health in the pursuit of sustainable solutions.

This was done through a study conducted in partnership with the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization – Regional Centre for Food and Nutrition (SEAMEO RECFON). This evidence was utilized to further the newly launched cross-sector National Action Plan for Improving the Welfare of School-Aged Children and Adolescents (RAN PIJAR) through strategic dialogue. This dialogue resulted in consensus among stakeholders on the importance of cross-sector collaboration for the nutrition of school-aged children.Additionally, to strengthen nutrition education, WFP digitalized nutrition education materials in partnership with the Centre for Data, Information and Technology of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology. WFP, the Ministry, UNICEF, and private sector partner evolve developed these materials in 2021. The materials aim to deliver messages on nutrition to primary school-aged children and guide parents, caretakers, and teachers in delivering these messages. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology has uploaded the materials on the UKS website, accessible by all. WFP also collaborated with the Ministry to communicate the materials nationally, embedded into the Ministry’s podcast, webinar, and web-series focused on school-aged children.WFP plans to continue supporting efforts enhancing synergies for improved nutrition among school-aged children in 2023.","180000","1546323","452042","WFP continued engagement with the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs to improve nutrition for schoolchildren under the National Action Plan for Improving the Welfare of School-Aged Children and Adolescents (RAN PIJAR). WFP facilitation of cross-sector collaboration for RAN PIJAR in 2022 and 2023 resulted in formal appointment into the national RAN PIJAR implementation team by the Coordinating Ministry. WFP joins eight government entities and the World Health Organization in this national team. Through this partnership, WFP will continue to strengthen multi-sector coordination for the expansion of access to quality health and nutrition services through school and family-based approaches.WFP continued policy engagement for potential synergy between the School Health Programme (UKS) and the Ministry of Social Affairs’ Family Hope Programme (PKH) for Integrated Primary School Nutrition (IPSN). This synergy aims to improve health and nutrition behaviours of parents and children while boosting the purchasing power of poor families to afford healthier food choices. At the sub-national level, WFP engaged its multi-sector national partnerships to begin laying the foundation for district-level IPSN model trials. The model will build upon existing government-led school-based nutrition programmes for schoolchildren, adding a critical educational component for parents or caregivers that aims to achieve synergy between school- and family- based nutrition education approaches. Through these engagements, WFP and government partners identified local needs opportunities, and challenges for the trials. WFP, in partnership with national and district governments will continue to refine and jointly implement IPSN model in 2024.Furthermore, WFP and the National Food Agency expanded their partnership in 2023 through the Agency's appointment of WFP into the national drafting team supporting a new Agency-led food and nutrition surveillance intervention targeting 25,000 primary schoolchildren in ten districts. Through technical assistance, including by leveraging its experiences with the 2016-2019 National Nutrition Programme for School Children to facilitate learning, WFP supported the launch of the technical guidelines.","587198","","","WFP and partners provided technical assistance for the planning and early design processes leading up to the launch of the new national free nutritious meals programme, including by drawing from global and regional expertise and lessons learned from supporting school-based nutrition interventions in Indonesia. Through a national supply chain optimization workshop, WFP and the Ministry of National Development Planning jointly facilitated the sharing of good practices from other countries with national authorities on optimizing supply chains and sourcing strategies for school-based nutrition interventions – including those in remote, hard to reach, and rural areas. Further aiming to bolster the new programme, WFP and partners advocated for Indonesia to join the global school meals coalition and succeeded in facilitating and affirming the Government’s pursuit of coalition membership. Being part of the global school meals coalition will help Indonesia to access resources from coalition members, share lessons learned, and adopt best practices.In partnership with subnational governments, WFP facilitated the institutionalization of mechanisms supporting the implementation of an upcoming Integrated Primary School Nutrition (IPSN) model pilot in the districts of Kupang (East Nusa Tenggara province) and Pasuruan (East Java province). The IPSN model approaches nutrition for school-aged children holistically, enriching existing government-led school-based nutrition programmes with family-based nutrition education and linkages with community stakeholders, such as healthcare providers. Stakeholders in Kupang district formalized Memorandums of Understanding linking health and education entities to provide nutrition services to over 1,000 primary schoolchildren in ten primary schools across the district. In Pasuruan district, WFP facilitated the launch of a regent’s decree formalizing a district-level multi-sector team comprised of nutrition, education, and health sector stakeholders to support the IPSN model pilot.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

UNFPA's intervention is deeply rooted in the recognition of the transformative potential of gender equality and women's empowerment within the realm of ARH education. The initiative acknowledges that improving ARH education not only enhances individual knowledge and decision-making but also serves as a catalyst for broader societal change by challenging existing norms, values, and power dynamics that perpetuate gender inequalities and discrimination. By collaborating with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), UNFPA works to develop comprehensive guidelines for the implementation of ARH education in schools. These guidelines are designed to ensure that ARH education is integrated into the national curriculum and delivered in a manner that is sensitive to the needs and rights of all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, the initiative involves analyzing the existing situation of ARH education across ministries, which likely includes sex-disaggregated data to identify disparities and inform targeted interventions. The project focuses on building the capacities of key stakeholders, particularly teachers and healthcare providers, to deliver high-quality ARH education. This includes the development and field testing of digital training platforms tailored to the needs of teachers, as well as the provision of technical assistance to enhance the skills of health providers in delivering ARH education in primary health centers. Moreover, efforts to engage parents in ARH education programs highlight a commitment to fostering gender-equitable partnerships between schools, healthcare facilities, and families. Through initiatives such as developing modules on a religious perspective on ARH education and promoting parent engagement, the project seeks to challenge existing norms and cultural values surrounding sexuality and reproductive health. By addressing these sensitive topics through an inclusive and rights-based approach, the initiative aims to contribute to broader shifts in societal attitudes towards gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights. In summary, it represents a concerted effort to advance gender equality and women's empowerment through transformative interventions in ARH education. By addressing gender disparities, challenging entrenched norms, and empowering individuals with knowledge and agency over their reproductive health, the initiative contributes to broader efforts to dismantle the root causes of gender inequalities and discrimination in Indonesia.","1 - Limited contribution to realization of human rights","-","Sub-output 1.1.6.5 aims to support policy development, advocacy, and capacity building to improve the quality of Adolescent Reproductive Health (ARH) education in both school and out-of-school settings. Although the initiative aims to improve ARH education, there is limited explicit mention of human rights principles or frameworks. While the focus is on enhancing the quality of ARH education, the description lacks a clear connection to the enjoyment or fulfillment of human rights, such as the right to education or the right to health. The initiative does not directly reference the utilization of normative frameworks or outcomes from treaty bodies or universal periodic reviews (UPR) to inform the activity. While the initiative may indirectly address discrimination or inequality related to access to ARH education, there is no explicit focus on targeting patterns of discrimination or marginalization. The emphasis is primarily on enhancing the quality of education without specific mention of addressing systemic inequalities that may affect marginalized or vulnerable populations. The description lacks explicit references to meaningful engagement with rights holders, such as adolescents, youth-led organizations, or marginalized communities. While the initiative involves capacity building for teachers and health care providers, there is limited mention of engagement with directly affected youth populations or their representatives. The initiative involves the development of guidelines, capacity building, and evaluation of ARH education initiatives, however there is limited mention of meaningful engagement with various stakeholders, including rights holders and beneficiary groups. The absence of robust stakeholder engagement reduces the likelihood of incorporating diverse perspectives, including those related to human rights. There is no indication of a thorough human rights analysis, including from a gender perspective, to inform the activity. While the initiative may indirectly address gender issues through its focus on ARH education, there is no explicit mention of conducting a comprehensive human rights analysis. Overall, while the sub-output contributes to improving ARH education, its limited consideration of human rights principles, frameworks, and stakeholders results, indicating a minor contribution to the realization of human rights within the overall outcomes of the initiative.","1 - Contributes to sustaining peace empowerment in a limited way","Sub-output 1.1.6.5 focuses on supporting policy development, advocacy, and capacity building to improve the quality of Adolescent Reproductive Health (ARH) education. The initiative begins with an analysis of the situation regarding ARH education in both school and out-of-school settings across ministries. This analysis likely includes assessing any existing challenges, gaps, or conflicts related to ARH education. By conducting such an analysis, the initiative demonstrates a proactive approach to understanding potential conflict drivers or vulnerabilities within the education system, thus laying the groundwork for conflict-sensitive interventions. It also aims to develop guidelines for the implementation of ARH education in schools, which will assist teachers and school administrators in delivering age-appropriate ARH education aligned with the national curriculum. Additionally, it includes developing modules on a religious perspective on ARH education, reflecting sensitivity to cultural and religious considerations in advocacy efforts. By advocating for comprehensive ARH education policies and guidelines, the initiative contributes to addressing social norms, stigma, and taboos surrounding reproductive health, which can be sources of conflict or marginalization. The initiative seeks to enhance the capacity of teachers and health providers to deliver ARH education effectively. This capacity building includes developing digital training platforms for teachers and providing technical assistance to health providers in primary health centers. By equipping educators and health providers with the necessary knowledge and skills to deliver ARH education, the initiative empowers them to address sensitive topics with confidence and accuracy, contributing to a more informed and empowered youth population. Another aspect of the initiative involves engaging parents in ARH education, recognizing the importance of parental involvement in promoting positive reproductive health outcomes for adolescents. By involving parents in discussions and activities related to ARH education, the initiative fosters community support and understanding, which can help mitigate potential sources of conflict or resistance to reproductive health education initiatives. The initiative includes an evaluation component to assess the impact of ARH education interventions both in-school and out-of-school settings. By systematically evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions, the initiative promotes a culture of learning and adaptation, ensuring that future efforts are evidence-based and responsive to the needs of adolescents and youth. In summary, it involves comprehensive efforts to improve the quality of ARH education through conflict-sensitive policy development, advocacy, capacity building, community engagement, and evaluation. By addressing reproductive health issues in a sensitive and inclusive manner, the initiative contributes to empowering youth and promoting peace and stability within communities.","-","margaretha sitanggang",,"1100680","640550","296156","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","279278","49189","49189","UNFPA: In the context of ARH education in school: UNFPA facilitated the signing of the MoU between the MoH and Ministry of Education (MoE) on joint training programmes for Reproductive Health education.

Collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MoE) strengthened ARH education in schools, with a workshop involving 3,569 participants, including educators and officials. The event highlighted peer teacher competency and best practices in adolescent health programs. Key achievements include integrating ARH education into school curricula, developing teaching guidelines, and documenting best practices. Challenges such as network issues and limited monitoring highlighted the need for stronger evaluation frameworks. Future efforts will focus on expanding outreach to Madrasah teachers, enhancing teacher training, and ensuring program sustainability through improved monitoring tools and digital innovations.2. UNFPA collaborated with LKK-NU to enhance ARH education in Islamic-based schools, focusing on Pesantren and Madrasah. Despite the cancellation of two technical coordination meetings, efforts were redirected to a successful workshop that strengthened collaboration and developed an ARH education module from a Family Maslahah perspective. The workshop engaged 25 participants, including representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and NGOs. Key outcomes included mapping ARH education progress, identifying challenges, and developing a framework for the ARH module. Challenges such as the taboo perception of reproductive health in traditional boarding schools and cultural obedience to kyai led to recommendations for personalized engagement strategies. The ARH module, designed for adolescents aged 13–18, aims to improve reproductive health knowledge and responsibility among students. Planned follow-up actions include focus group discussions, documentation of ARH issues, and the development of a monitoring and evaluation system in 2025. By 2026, Islamic-based ARH reference books will be developed and distributed to Pesantren for broader impact.","299163","299163","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

UNICEF’s advocacy efforts at the provincial and district levels led to enhanced commitment from Papua and West Papua provinces for the adoption and replication of HI-ECD services. As part of this work, UNICEF drew upon the high-level advocacy power of the Papua Governor’s wife. HI-ECD guidance was disseminated to 15 districts within Papua Province, resulting in requests for UNICEF technical assistance to implement HI-ECD in 6 districts. In West Papua, UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Bunda PAUD task force (cross-sectoral coordination led by the wife of the head of the district) in Sorong and Raja Ampat districts to develop a HI-ECD regional action plan as the reference for local HI-ECD regulation and budget development.
At the national level, an action plan and technical guideline for the implementation of HI-ECD was launched and promulgated by the Government. These are intended as a reference for provincial and district governments to develop HI-ECD regulations and policies to support introduction and expansion of these essential services.
In partnership with Indonesia’s Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), UNICEF worked on the development and adaptation of an instrument for measuring developmental outcomes of children aged 24–59 months, based on the new Early Child Development Index (ECDI2030). Successful integration of this instrument within national surveys, such as SUSENAS 2022, will enable more comprehensive monitoring of SDG4, particularly concerning SDG 4.2.1 relating to early childhood development.
To address the urgent learning and development needs of young children, including COVID-19-related learning and development setbacks, and to better prepare young children to become ready to transition to primary school, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalized, UNICEF supported the Government to develop a teacher pocketbook on early literacy and numeracy for children aged 5–6 years and 7–8 years. The draft pocketbook is expected to be tested and finalized in mid-2022. The pocketbook will also be developed and adjusted for the parents to support their children on foundational learning from home. Digital versions of these resources will be also be prepared in 2022.
As part of scaling-up HI-ECD services to young vulnerable children, UNICEF initiated the development of a Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) strategy to support implementation of its parenting programme in West Papua. The parenting programme aims to improve parents’ knowledge and behaviour in providing nurturing caregiving to their children and includes a financial literacy component. At least 400 parents, through approximately 40 parenting groups, will be engaged in this programme by the end of 2021. Preparatory work for programme roll-out has already been undertaken, with the training of 80 facilitators and 6 trainers from Sorong and Raja Ampat districts.

UNICEF proactively advocated for the adoption of this revision through parliamentary contacts. Unfortunately, the review of this law was postponed, and is unlikely to be reviewed again before the 2024 elections.In 2022, replication of HI-ECD services reached 11 out of 20 targeted districts, assisting disadvantaged children to recover from serious learning loss, the health and psychosocial impacts of COVID-19, and to prevent COVID-19 transmission. The programme was implemented in disadvantaged communities across three target provinces: South Sulawesi, Papua and NTT. The 11 districts were reached due to a mid-year expansion of the programme to six districts across three provinces.UNICEF also continued to conduct a parenting programme in poor and disadvantaged communities in West Papua. This programme is working to improve parents’ knowledge and behaviour in providing nurturing caregiving to their children and includes a financial literacy component. A total of 40 parenting groups were engaged in this programme, including 940 parents (786 female, 154 male). Approximately 1,454 children aged 0-6 years indirectly benefitted from this programme.In partnership with Indonesia’s Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), and in consultation with Bappenas, UNICEF continued to work on the development and adaptation of an instrument for measuring developmental outcomes of children aged 24–59 months, based on the new Early Child Development Index (ECDI2030). This work is being conducted with the intention to have a refined instrument available for integration into the country’s national socioeconomic survey (Susenas) by 2024, to facilitate monitoring of progress against SDG4.2.1. The results of the EDCI2030 pilot, which took place in two districts/cities, have been drafted and are expected to be disseminated amongst key partners, such as Bappenas, in early 2023. Initial results show that most of the children assessed aged 24-59 months are developmentally on-track; 84 per cent and 91 per cent in Pangandaran district and Cirebon city, respectively. However, lower achievement of child development indicators was noted amongst older children.As part of UNICEF’s strong commitment to assist children to catch up on learning lost due to the pandemic, UNICEF provided technical assistance to MoECRT to develop a pocketbook both for teachers and parents respectively on early literacy and numeracy for children aged 5–6 years and 7–8 years, respectively. In parallel to the development of this teacher’s pocketbook, a set of micro learning videos are being developed to be used as complementary material to the pocketbook and are expected to be uploaded to MoECRT’s Merdeka Mengajar digital learning platform by early 2023, to be accessible for all early childhood education (ECE) teachers across the country","2069360","738166","738072","UNICEFAchievement against ECDI2030 has been included as an indicator in the draft RPJMN 2025-2029.

Having ECDI2030 integrated in this key national plan will enable government to effectively monitor progress towards achieving early childhood development-related SDGs in Indonesia. Quality early childhood development (ECD) services were replicated and scaled up in 24 out of 30 targeted districts with UNICEF support. The programme was implemented in disadvantaged communities across three target provinces: South Sulawesi, NTT, and Papua. By the end of November 2023, 16,561 young children (51 per cent girls; 49 per cent boys) were assisted to improve their learning and development outcomes, primarily through improved teaching practices of 1,026 teachers and principals (86 per cent female; 14 per cent male) resulting from in-service training supported by UNICEF, and through the provision of teaching and learning kits promoting inclusive play-based learning and development activities to some 308 ECD centres. Furthermore, due to UNICEF’s support, teachers and principals effectively engaged with some 11,399 parents and caregivers including fathers (83 per cent female; 17 per cent male), promoting equal responsibility of caregiving.   Furthermore, regulations designed to promote the replication and scale-up of holistic integrated ECD (HI-ECD) services by local government were introduced in several provinces. In South Sulawesi, the Governor promulgated a decree on HI-ECD. Similarly, a Governor Regulation on HI-ECD in NTT and the Head of District (Bupati) Regulation on HI-ECD in South Central Timor and Rote Ndao districts were finalized and promulgated. For Papua, a new Presidential Regulation was promulgated, ensuring that HI-ECD and one-year pre-primary education is being routinely planned and budgeted for using the Papua special autonomy fund (OTSUS) from 2024 to 2041. These governments have contributed the equivalent of US$192,000 for programme implementation in 2023 with additional allocations totalling US$178,000 planned for 2024 to expand the programme within their respective areas.UNICEF’s continued advocacy for increasing investment in early learning and development, and evidence generated of the positive impact of this investment in the Indonesia context, contributed to the inclusion of a universal one year of pre-primary education in the draft of National Long Term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2025-2045 being prepared by the Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas). If the plan is finalized with this included, it will provide a stronger basis for Indonesia to amend the National Education System Law to extend compulsory education from 12 to 13 years.  As part of UNICEF’s strong commitment to fostering school readiness among young children, technical assistance was provided to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (MoECRT) to create micro-learning videos as supplementary material for teachers, focusing on early literacy and numeracy for children aged 5–6 years. These resources were integrated into MoECRT's digital learning platform for teachers, which is being used by 2.6 million teachers across multiple education sub-sectors. -----","709919","709919","709919","UNICEF:The ECDI2030 is now integrated into the national Family Data Collection (Pendataan Keluarga) initiative, led by BKKBN with support from BAPPENAS and BPS. Data cleaning and processing are ongoing, with data analysis and reporting expected in December 2024. This result will form the baseline of the ECDI2030 indicator in the new RPJMN and enable the government to monitor progress towards achieving early childhood development-related SDGs. UNICEF supported the replication and scale-up of quality early childhood development (ECD) services to reach 33 out of 34 targeted districts in 2024, including nine additional districts in 2024 alone. By the end of November 2024, 18,652 young children (49 per cent girls, 51 per cent boys) had been helped to improve their learning and development outcomes, primarily through the improved teaching practices of 755 teachers and principals (90 per cent female, 10 per cent male). This was due to UNICEF-supported in-service training and the provision of teaching and learning kits that promote inclusive play-based learning activities to 196 ECD centres. Furthermore, teachers and principals effectively engaged with around 7,167 parents and caregivers (87 per cent female, 13 per cent male), promoting nurturing care practices for their children’s learning and development. A key finding highlights the importance of empowering female teachers and caregivers, who comprise 90 per cent and 87 per cent respectively of these groups. The programme specifically included training on promoting gender equity within early learning settings and the provision of ECD learning materials that foster equitable learning opportunities for both girls and boys, with and without disabilities, through play-based activities. Regulations to promote the replication and scale-up of Holistic Integrated ECD (HI-ECD) services by local governments were introduced in several districts. In Rote Ndao, the district planning and development agency coordinated the preparation of the district’s five year (2025-2029) costed action plan to replicate and scale up HI-ECD services. Based on the new action plan, the Rote Ndao district government allocated an indicative budget of IDR148,350,000,000 (USD 9.3 million) to the education sector for ECD programmes from 2025 to 2029. In 2024, local governments allocated a significant budget to HI-ECD: approximately IDR 420 million (USD 25,365) in Rote Ndao and IDR 4.7 billion (USD 289,041) in Sarmi district. UNICEF’s continued advocacy for increasing investment in early learning and development. With technical assistance from UNICEF, MoHA developed a guideline for HI-ECD planning and budgeting. The utilization of this guideline by local governments nationwide is intended to promote quality improvements in early learning and development services, and one year of universal pre-primary education, given that this is now a priority in the RPJMN and the National Long Term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2025-2045. Lastly, with UNICEF's technical support, BKKBN developed and launched the Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) National Strategy on Parenting. The strategy was implemented in 175 villages across 34 provinces and increased parent participation in infant parenting groups (Bina Keluarga Balita – BKB) from 6,045 participants in June to 13,244 participants in September 2024","896058","521534","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In addition to the decrees issued by DfA on 20 December and 24 December 2022, which limited women’s access to universities and international and national non-government organizations (NGOs) in the workplace respectively, an additional directive was verbally communicated to include the United Nations on 4 April 2023. These decisions further restricted women’s rights and freedom and affected the quality of programme delivery. The operating space was further restricted, particularly for international NGOs (INGOs), on 6 June 2023 when the de facto Minister of Education announced that all INGOs working in the education sector must hand over their portfolios to national NGOs (NNGOs).  UNICEF and Save the Children, as Education Cluster co-leads, were able to successfully negotiate space and time for a transition that would not jeopardize children's continued access to education. By the end of 2023, all INGO-led CBE classes have been transitioned to local NGOs. UNICEF has also launched a project management accompaniment which will act as a resource to provide financial and operational capacity building to NNGOs. UNICEF continues to negotiate with the de facto MoE for a well-defined and strategic role for INGOs beyond 2023. Despite these challenges, the CBE programme has further expanded in 2023, UNICEF supported over 680,000 children (60% girls) with access to education through around 21,000 CBE classes in all 34 provinces, representing more than a 30 per cent increase in the number of CBE classes compared to December 2022. At the time of reporting all CBE classes are functional, except for Helmand and Kandahar, where around 2,400 CBE classes were closed in late April 2023, due to tensions between local religious leaders and CBE implementing partners. UNICEF continues to engage with the DFA to find solutions for these learners. To increase different modalities to reach children out of school, UNICEF has been supporting individuals, small CSOs, and NGOs with small-scale, largely face-to-face, initiatives including implementing innovative initiatives that provide learning opportunities for those not reached by CBE or public schools and the development of life/technical and vocational skills, using a variety of approaches involving no, low, or high technology, depending on feasibility in specific contexts. Given the increase in poverty and economic and financial crisis, the lack of learning materials has become a critical factor behind many families’ decision to send their children to school. With support from several key donors such as ADB, WB, ECHO, and the Government of Korea, UNICEF has been able to provide basic learning materials for all grade one and six students, both girls and boys in all 34 provinces. In 2023, over 6 million primary grade students (39 per cent of girls) received the full package of TLM. This was further supplemented by the provision of textbooks.                   ","178083723","101944869","101932774","UNICEF continued to support 576,516 children (64% of them girls) in accessing education services through 17,974 community-based education (CBE) classes. They also supported small-scale partnerships to deliver alternative education programmes for secondary-level girls and funded a promising distance learning initiative through television, radio, and online/offline platforms. To address barriers like poverty and distance to school, UNICEF implemented distance learning programmes via television, radio, and mobile applications. In 2024, over 3.5 million students (40% girls) received textbooks and teaching materials. This provision of teaching and learning materials will continue throughout the academic year to sustain and reinforce learning outcomes.","98357724","14901991","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Despite some delays in curriculum revisions, the year was marked by capacity-building initiatives, laying a robust foundation for the future integration and enhancement of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE). In collaboration with UNICEF, UNFPA played a key role in merging health and educational strategies. This effort was highlighted by the enactment of clause 28.10 in the education law,paving the way for a school-based student health monitoring system. Joint assessments on the implementation of the health education curriculum were conducted to develop the SchoolHealth Program, aligning closely with government objectives.Digital Empowerment:Digital engagement in sexuality education leapt forward with the expansion of the AMAZE videos on www.medle.mn. The addition of 60 new videos brought the total to 110, significantly enhancing the digital reach and impacting over a million individuals – a 50% increase compared to the previous year. The adaptation of the teacher's guide for the Mongolian context enriched the content, making it more relevant and engaging for users.Capacity Building and Teacher Training:A major focus in 2023 was on building the capacity of health education teachers. Out of 1,212 teachers identified, 31 were trained as master trainers, who then went on to enhance the skills of 231 health education teachers across various provinces and districts. This master trainer initiative marked a pivotal step in our commitment to improving the quality of health education. Additionally, enhanced digital learning modules were introduced, covering a broad spectrum of health topics and reaching 638 teachers, with 235 actively engaging with them throughout the year. This combination of master trainer-led sessions and digital learning modules significantly narrowed the training gap for health education teachers, showcasing a strategic and effective approach to elevating the standards of CSE.Inclusive Teaching Methodologies:Efforts were intensified to integrate inclusive teaching methods into training programs, ensuring CSE adaptability for all secondary school students, particularly those with special needs. Tailored guidelines and detailed methodological guidance were developed to support this endeavour. During the reporting period, with the support of UNFPA, the Ministry of Education has revised the health education curriculum to better serve children with special needs. Specialized guidelines and comprehensive methodological guidance have been developed and implemented for this curriculum. These resources are specifically designed to aid health education teachers in effectively delivering a more inclusive and adaptable curriculum to students with special needs.Life Skills E-Modules:Building on the momentum from the previous year, additional e-modules focusing on life skills were developed for teachers at lifelong learning centres, further enriching the educational resources available to educators.Research and Analysis:The year also saw comprehensive research and analysis activities. A nationwide assessment of the health education curriculum was conducted jointly by MoES and MoH. Furthermore, asituational analysis was carried out to identify gaps and opportunities for preventing gender-based violence through CSE interventions in Mongolia. This analysis is instrumental in informing the development of a theory of change for the ""Gender-based violence is prevented and all women and girls live free from violence"" project, setting the direction for government implementation strategies into 2024 and beyond.","275966","275966","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Implementation of innovative learning tools and alternative approaches to ECE is already underway, resulting in a more inclusive and efficient education system. UNICEF advocacy has been instrumental in raising awareness among national and sub-national decision-makers about the critical importance of early childhood education (ECE) in building a solid foundation for children, fostering lifelong learning, and driving economic growth. The implementation of teacher training and capacity-building initiatives has successfully created a nurturing and inclusive learning environment for young children, ensuring high-quality education.Implementation of Child Protection Policy in Kindergartens,"" ""Quality Meal Production at the Kindergarten,"" and ""Psychological First Aid for Young Children, Teachers, and Parents,"" through online and offline methods have established a comprehensive learning platform for early childhood education (ECE) professionals and practitioners. These modules have equipped kindergarten staff and managers with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively implement child protection policies and ensure the provision of high-quality meals. As a result, 290 ECE practitioners, professionals, and managers have been trained, benefiting 47,190 children, including 23,149 girls and 110 children with disabilities. This has led to the creation of a child-friendly learning environment and improved capacity for serving healthy and nutritious food in kindergartens across Khentii, Sukhbaatar, Dundgovi, Umnugobi provinces, as well as Songinokhairkhan and Bayanzurkh districts. During the reporting period, ECE services were made available to the children of border military personnel (frontline workers) who were stationed on the state border. These services were made possible through the collaborative cost-sharing efforts of local authorities and organizations. As a result, a total of 150 children were enrolled and benefited from these preschool education services. Furthermore, the implementation of a disaster recovery plan in partnership with the local government in areas affected by snowstorms and floods has resulted in the uninterrupted participation of 1,450 children (including 754 girls) in early childhood education (ECE) services in Sukhbaatar province, Sukhbaatar and Bayanzurkh districts of Ulaanbaatar city. This successful initiative serves as a positive example of how to involve local authorities in ensuring the continuous inclusion of young children in ECE services without any disruption in remote areas.  Lessons learnedUNICEF with the cooperation of MoES has introduced innovative alternative ECE programs for children in remote rural areas and children from herder families. ECE alternative program was expanded this year by introducing the “Teacher with Tablet” program which is a tablet-assisted learning tool in home-based ECE services. This program was implemented in remote communities where ECE services are not available and program implementation is based on principles of the door-to-door outreach programs. The content of tablet-based learning tools follows the national curriculum for pre-primary education, and it consists of a guidebook for teachers and parents and a workbook for children. The ""Tablet with Teacher"" program resulted in over 3,600 children and their parents participating in ECE service from 100 remote communities that were not connected internet. Furthermore, the Teacher with Tablet program practiced teacher-child-parent learning together, testing new ideas, and engaging in active learning. There were a few key ingredients that can support innovation in the early childhood field: ideas for taking action that are grounded in the latest science and informed by on-the-ground experience. The tablet-assisted tool allowed to young children learn interactive content used on devices such as a tablet, and gaming systems such as giving young children the ability to participate and guide themselves through learning.Also, it contributed to improving engagement in health, nutrition, education, WASH, and child protection sectors ensuring integrated support for children in remote communities.  UNICEF Contribution:- Teacher with Tablet program. This led to the participation of over 3,600 children, including 2,371 girls and 41 children with disabilities, and their parents in home-based ECE services in 300 remote communities. The teachers successfully incorporated ICT into their daily teaching and learning activities.- A tablet-assisted learning tool was developed, and paper-based versions were published and distributed to 2000 parents and 6000 children and their parents.- In response to a snowstorm and floods, 3 kindergartens in affected areas were able to provide ECE services to 1,450 children, including 754 girls, in remote communities.- Kindergarten and childcare centers were established at Border Control Units, resulting in the participation of 150 children, including 78 girls, and their parents in ECE services.- 3 innovative training modules were developed for ECE professionals and practitioners. These modules, available both online and offline, contributed to the expansion of the learning hub. In 2023, a total of 290 teachers, kindergarten managers, and staff acquired these training modules, benefiting 47,190 children by improving the accessibility, inclusivity, and quality of ECE services.- Renovation of kitchen supplies in 2 kindergartens enabled the provision of healthy and nutritious food to 949 children, including 440 girls and 5 children with disabilities.- A guidebook for the implementation of the Child Protection Policy in kindergartens was developed, published, and distributed to 3000 public and private kindergartens.PartnershipThe Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) played a key and strategic role as a partner. MCO collaborated with MoES to obtain approval for The Package Law on Education and finalize The conceptual framework for developing a national curriculum.MCO expanded its partnership with The General Authority of Education to enhance access and strengthen ECE services and systems for children in remote communities.MCO initiated a partnership with The provinces (Sukhbaatar, Dundgobi, and Dornod) and districts (Bayanzurkh and Songinokahiarkhan) 21:21 offices, conducting cost-sharing activities that included establishing ECE services and childcare centers, as well as strengthening human resource management to improve ECE outcomes.                                                                                                                                       MCO maintained its cooperation with Local Education Departments and The Mongolian National University of Education. As a result, training modules were developed and disseminated to enhance The quality of ECE services, as well as parenting skills and communication with children.

Given the increased mobility of Mongolian students the accreditation and recognition of qualification issues had been very critical. The Mongolian higher education officials had been trained to ensure high quality higher education opportunities are available to everyone.

Based on a pilot initiative in 4 provinces and in-service teacher training courses in 16 provinces in early 2023, this training approach was further contextualized, adapted, and refined for replication on a larger scale. Follow 6-day training courses were conducted for 4503 (2285 females) primary school teachers from 16 provinces, focusing on effective pedagogy, lesson planning, classroom management, and assessment of/for learning. Further, a 6-day training course for 218 teachers (177 female and 41 male) was conducted in Herat and Paktya on classroom safety and security and social and emotional learning. These training courses helped fine-tune the strategy for site-based, modular, and integrated teacher training and support intervention to be rolled out at scale in early 2024. The integrated approach entails building capacities of headteachers, academic supervisors, teacher trainers, and school management shuras. 700 (150 females) headteachers from Kabul attended a 6-day training course. Whereas 993 (62 females) academic supervisors from Paktya, Laghman, Kapisa, Ghor and Badghis provinces attended 10-day training courses. Feedback from these courses will help refine the course design and materials, tailored toward creating a supportive environment for teachers and sustained improvement in teaching/learning. Significant progress was made by opening the Girls’ Access to Teacher Education (GATE) classes for 2,683 trainees in 15 provinces. However, a verbal decree, issued on 7 August 2023, to suspend/close the GATE classes constrained the programme implementation, affecting GATE classes in most of the provinces. The targeted advocacy contributed to the reopening of the face-to-face GATE classes for 1390 trainees in 8 provinces and self/distance learning, benefiting 758 students in 2 provinces. To improve the quality of instruction in CBE schools, training materials for teachers and SMSs were revised and the quality of the training manuals was improved. Finalized ready-to-print teacher training materials, both Dari and Pashto versions, are available and have been shared with CBE IPs. CBE IPs benefited from orientation training courses on the revised package. These training materials will be used to train CBE teachers across the country. Two ECE and ECD studies were commissioned in 2023. The ECE study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the current ECE intervention and the ECD study on mapping existing practices. The Teacher Development and Support Forum (TDSF) brought together advance coordinated action and support on teacher development and support. Despite constraints, including the ban on female professionals and limitations for INGOs working in the education sector, TDSF continued functioning.              ","24685949","16799066","16365303","UNICEF, with Cambridge Education's support, conducted a baseline survey in 10 provinces in late 2023. The training approach was then contextualized and adapted for larger-scale replication, resulting in a comprehensive in-service programme. Training was divided into manageable modules, followed by coaching within schools. The training included teachers, headteachers, teacher educators, and School Management Shura (SMS) members, fostering a supportive school environment. UNICEF completed training for 3,471 teachers (1,410 male and 2,061 female), 619 headteachers (401 male and 218 female), and 370 senior teacher educators (329 male and 51 female) in 10 provinces. The programme will expand to 25 provinces, targeting approximately 34,000 teachers.

The first area involves conducting mobile outreach clinics to serve marginalized communities, while the second area provides support for referral care for those requiring specialized treatment. The project is implemented through two main partners: the Malaysian Relief Agency (MRA) and the Tzu Chi Foundation.The Tzu Chi Foundation primarily manages the mobile outreach clinics. These clinics offer primary healthcare services through two service centers operated by the foundation in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley. The foundation also coordinates with Primary Health Care (PHC) clinics of the Ministry of Health to align services with government requirements. All costs incurred for vulnerable participants are covered by the project to ensure equity in access to care. Additionally, the Tzu Chi Foundation conducts community awareness campaigns focused on health promotion and disease prevention. Opportunistic services are provided to identify unregistered refugees, assisting them with registration to access benefits and arranging referral memos for additional PHC and curative care. In 2024, 848 beneficiaries have already received PHC services, and it is expected that 2,100 beneficiaries will be served in 2025.The MRA is responsible for supporting referral services for necessary curative care. Through regular communication and screening, vulnerable individuals are identified and referred for specialized treatment, with continuous follow-up until the medical care is completed. In 2024, 45 individuals with medical or surgical conditions were supported through the project’s referral services to public hospitals, and it is anticipated that an additional 80 individuals will receive similar support in 2025.The project implementation, guidance, and progress review are overseen through steering committee meetings and quarterly progress reports. Additionally, steering committee meetings with UNHCR, WHO, and the two implementing partners are planned for early next year to review the current progress, assess remaining plans, and address any gaps for smooth implementation to deliver expected outcome.The project is ongoing and will continue during 2025.","18200","18200","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

For the first time, all provinces developed their learning recovery programmes with alignment to a standardised national framework. UNICEF financially and technically supported the implementation of action plans and strengthened the assessment frameworks in line with the newly formulated key performance indicators for education. At provincial level, UNICEF supported learning recovery programmes for more than 26,000 low-performing students in 500 schools in Uva, Central, Eastern and Northern provinces. This included technical support to train approximately 2,000 teachers on multi-level, child-centred pedagogy, resulting in quality improvements. To encourage active student and teacher participation in these programmes after school hours, students were provided with nutritious refreshments and teachers and principals received transportation allowances. As part of the emergency response, UNICEF provided teaching and learning materials for 85,000 students and 2,700 teachers in five provinces. The MoE launched a nationwide capacity development programme for education zonal officials on psychosocial support. UNICEF supported 100 zonal level trainings (one per education zone) for 60 officials in each school, reaching 6,000 people. In the next 18 months, the trained officials will visit between 1-3 schools to train teachers, through which approximately 60,000 teachers (around 40 per cent) will be trained.  Further, to challenge the stigma around menstruation and prevent adolescent girls from missing school, 6,000 adolescent girls received menstrual hygiene supplies and printed materials through community workshops delivered by medical doctors across the island.

These included studies on school dropout rates, school language, impact assessment of a Girls’ Stipend programme, and the development of early learning development assessment standards. Technical assistance strengthened provincial education data systems for improved planning and monitoring. Moreover, UNICEF provided crucial coordination to the education sector through various platforms. This enabled a more coordinated response to the 2022 flood emergency and recovery phases. Additionally, UNICEF's coordination efforts extended to supporting the implementation of provincial sector plans and policies, thereby contributing to the overall enhancement of the education sector.        In 2023, UNICEF provided technical support to the Ministry of Federal Education and provincial education departments. Collaborative efforts led to strategic studies addressing key bottlenecks to improve capacities and education service delivery. In Balochistan, a functional review of the School Education Department Balochistan and studies on School Dropouts and School Language were conducted. In KP, focus centered on identifying critical student learning outcomes, to develop a scheme of studies targeting foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). Punjab received support for early learning development assessment standards, a SEAH (safeguarding against sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment) risk assessment and evaluability assessment of a GPE funded programme. In Sindh, UNICEF’s technical assistance led to the development of rules for the Act on Prohibition of Corporal Punishment, an impact assessment for the girls' stipend programme, and a policy brief on gender-responsive budgeting. UNICEF contributed to strengthening data systems in all provinces, including GB, for improved planning and monitoring. This includes developing system enhancement requirements for the performance management cell/EMIS in Balochistan, integrating databases into the EMIS in KP and Sindh, and creating modules for HRMIS and student information system in GB.UNICEF, co-leading the ESWG on EiE, continued coordinating the 2022 flood response and recovery, along with addressing refugees’ challenges. A joint needs assessment in 20 flood affected districts will inform planning for any remaining EiE needs. UNICEF remained co-chair of the NEDPG, as well as the coordinating agency for the education sector in Balochistan, KP and Sindh. Technical support aided joint education sector reviews (JESRs) in KP and Punjab, to assess the achievement of planned results of the education sector plans, identifying bottlenecks, and recommending actions. UNICEF also supported provincial education departments in developing partnership compact documents for new GPE funding. UNICEF successfully advocated for prioritizing foundational learning, to tackle the learning crisis.The primary challenge in implementation stems from political instability marked by frequent transfers and postings within education departments. This instability often results in delays in decision making by government implementing partners and necessitates revisiting programme activities, causing an overall slowdown in implementation. Despite these challenges, substantial progress has been made as highlighted earlier, in strengthening the education planning and decision-making system, conceptualizing, and developing foundational learning designs, and enhancing coordination among stakeholders in the education sector.

These initiatives encompass alternative learning pathways, afternoon schools, and non-formal skills development components, across all provinces. Additionally, UNICEF's efforts are geared towards enhancing the quality of education at the middle level, particularly leveraging digital technologies. Thus far, 12,322 adolescents in Balochistan, KP, and Sindh have benefitted from these initiatives aimed at improving educational standards. In the context of enhancing capacities to deliver quality education and skills development to adolescents, a key document, the GenU country operating plan was finalized. In addition, an innovative, evidence-based model was developed to integrate accelerated learning, skills training, and labor market linkages, offering a hybrid solution for out of school adolescents.To expand access to learning opportunities for out of school adolescents, various interventions were implemented. This includes post-primary learning in non-formal centre reaching 11,629 adolescents (73 per cent girls); afternoon schools for 92,072 adolescents (62 per cent girls), and blended education and skills development programmes initiated in Balochistan and Punjab. Furthermore, a programme enhancing 21st century skills for 1,700 out of school adolescent girls who were Afghan refugees or in host communities, in Balochistan and KP, was launched in 2023.Digital solutions were employed to enhance the capacities for quality service delivery in middle level education. These solutions included the Sindh learning passport, supporting 4,700 girls in grades 7 and 8 to access the digital content in schools, and remote teaching on specialized subjects in middle schools benefitting 7,622 adolescents in Balochistan and KP. Young people’s engagement and skills were enhanced through innovation challenges, including the Living Indus Green Startup Challenge, Policy Research Challenge, Foresight Fellowship, ADAP Youth leadership training, GenU Incubation week, a regional adolescent workshop in Nepal, and participation in COP28. Identified challenges included the absence of sufficient data and evidence in the realm of skills development and blended education, limiting the assessment of requirements and the formulation of appropriate strategies. Moreover, the availability of trainers and facilities for various skills and trades emerged as a notable hurdle. While initiatives are currently being piloted in Balochistan and KP, these endeavors aim to provide valuable insights and adjustments before any potential scaling up. These pilot initiatives should offer crucial lessons for refinement and adaptation before broader implementation.","10850609","8647806","8647806","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

These trainings, based on the localisation of the ILO's Supporting Children's Rights through Education, the Arts, and Music (SCREAM) module, significantly enhanced the teachers' ability to educate and empower children and youth. The SCREAM methodology leverages education, arts, and media to raise awareness about child labour and promote children's rights. By equipping teachers with these essential tools, the initiative aimed to foster a supportive environment where children and youth can actively advocate for their rights and combat child labour through creative and educational means.. This was implemented by the -(GALAB) Accelerator Lab 8.7 USDOL Global Support: Intensify action against forced labor and child labor through innovation.

The ILO's flagship awareness-raising tool, the SCREAM Education Pack (Supporting Children's Rights through Education, the Arts, and Media), was successfully localized and adapted into the Malaysian context, resulting in the creation of SUARAKAN: Hentikan Buruh Kanak-Kanak.

Although different statements from the De Facto Authorities (DfA) indicate that the decision on girl’s education will be reversed, an official announcement providing clarity under what conditions this will happen is still pending. The restriction affects an estimated 1.1 million adolescent girls, as well as future generations of girls. Despite the restriction, secondary schools remain open for girls in 9 provinces: in 5 provinces secondary schools were fully open for girls, while in 4 provinces schools in some districts were open while in others, they remained closed. UNICEF continues to monitor the situation on the ground through staff and extenders and partners.
In this reporting period, around 283,000 children (55% girls) were provided education opportunities through 9,887 community-based education (CBE) classes supported by UNICEF and implementing partners. Partnership arrangements are being finalized with new and existing implementing partners to open an additional 5,200 new CBE classes in 19 targeted provinces.","739181476","73424321","73424321","   In 2022, humanitarian access increased, allowing education actors to reach previously underserved communities. Likewise, communities have been putting pressure on the de facto authorities to open schools, enabling UNICEF to scale up the provision of community-based education (CBE) across the country: 529,292 school-aged children (55% girls) were reached in 28 provinces through multi-donor CBE program, with teacher and school management shura member (SMS) trainings provided in 14,981 community-based schools. Shuras continue to act as supportive structures both in the establishment of CBE classes, in monitoring and ensuring classes keep running. To enhance the overall quality of the program and standardize delivery across funding streams/donors, UNICEF has undertaken a review of the CBE package, including teacher training modules and linkages to the 2020 Comprehensive School Safety Framework.   In combination with the above expansion, UNICEF significantly scaled up its procurement and distribution of teaching and learning materials (TLM) for children across the country – reaching beyond CBE to directly support nearly 5 million public school-enrolled children throughout the country with TLM and textbooks for all grades in Primary school. In early 2023, UNICEF will complete the distribution of TLMs in cold climate classes. The original target to be reached with textbooks was higher and had been agreed under the previous Government: however, after August 2021, state assets were frozen, and the de facto authorities were unable to pay the invoices to release the remaining textbooks from the suppliers. Through successful resource mobilization, UNICEF will however be able to cover textbooks to all children from Grade 1 to Grade 12 and complete distribution in 2023.  Finally, in the Southern Region and with support from the Government of Italy, 200 previously closed public schools have been reopened in 4 provinces: Kandahar, Helmand, Urozgan and Zabul: children have been enrolled, teachers and school management shura members have been recruited and trained, with infrastructure repairs or new construction ongoing and to be continued in 2023 to increase reach.

In line with the current National Action Plan, under the government-led curricula reforms, UNICEF worked with the National Institute of Education (NIE) to incorporate Sport for Development (S4D) concepts into the Health and Physical Education curriculum for Grades 6, 8 and 10. S4D focuses on promoting life skills, including skills for social cohesion, among students, and will be piloted in 100 selected schools across the country. Further, 530 provincial resource team members were trained on the supplementary material developed by the NIE incorporating transversal skills into the Grade 6 Sinhala and Tamil language subjects. The material is currently being disseminated to all schools covering Grade 6 language teachers (Sinhala 7,000 and Tamil 2,000). Another key area of work with the NIE has been on strengthening the capacities of teachers on promoting civic values among students using activity-based techniques. This will be piloted in the National Colleges of Education for pre-service teacher education next year.    ","532000","169738","169738","The MoE with UNICEF has undertaken the review of the National Action Plan on Education for Social Cohesion (2017), which looks at the implementation status of the Action Plan and provides a framework of actions, with indicative cost in-line with the current country context. This timely intervention informs the government’s education reforms, particularly focusing on social cohesion promotion and skills development in general education.  UNICEF has been working with the National Institute of Education (NIE) to promote social cohesion skills, particularly focusing on the Health and Physical Education subject in secondary education. This is done through integrating ‘Sport for Development’ (S4D) approaches for grades 6 and 8 this year. The University Grant Commission (UGC) has published the study on “Relevance of Ragging and Sexual and Gender Based Violence in Sri Lanka State Universities”. The strategies developed based on the key findings have been issued to all state universities though a UGC circular followed by focal person deployed in universities for actions. In-line with the strategies a mandatory course has been introduced for all the university students for the prevention ragging and harmful behaviors, which demonstrated a sustainable model.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Being an active member of the LEG and a key partner of the MOE, UNICEF successfully advocated for equity and inclusion in the education transformation agenda in the Maldives. Our advocacy position and programmatic priorities in education have emphasized the importance of dealing concretely with disability inclusion, gender, geographic inequities, out of school children and children in vulnerable circumstances, including in emergencies, as we advance inclusion in education. Consequently, UNICEF was chosen by the LEG as the grant agent for the GPE Systems Transformation Grant and System capacity grant for a combined USD 6.5 million.UNICEF also drove the digital learning agenda and continued to explore partnerships for digital learning. As such, with support from the UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia, a partnership between UNICEF and Google was agreed to test a digital learning innovation in the Maldives, entailing funding amounting to USD500,000 and in-kind support worth USD 250,000.UNICEF led the skills transformation agenda through the introduction of UPSHIFT, which is a 21st century skills development program centered around design thinking in 48 schools, reaching a total of 2199 students and building the capacities of 218 teachers (male: 80; Female138). The office had a shift in strategy and identified 15 champion schools that will drive UPSHIFT and continued to have conversation on how to move UPSHIFT from a project into a transformative pedagogy.UNICEF also maintained its focus on addressing learning loss from COVID and strengthened foundational learning at pre-primary and primary level, increased the capacities of a total of 544 teachers (517 female; 27 male) teachers, reaching a total of 16,410 students ( males 8474; female 7936).  Following the approval of the Inclusive Education Policy, UNICEF invested in convening and connecting local level stakeholders for collective action and policy influence. As such, an ecosystem consisting of 172 multisectoral stakeholders (males 112; females 62) from 5 regions across the country were established in islands to identify issues and linking them with policy.

These initiatives marked a substantial advance in reaching and engaging marginalized youth through diverse and accessible channels. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security, ""Unitel Group"" and the UNFPA  jointly established Digital hubs to support the development of the 21st skills of marginalized youth. The skills development opportunities offered by the hubs are technical thinking of children and youth, the use of the Internet, computers and smart devices, education, and the proper use of free time. Within the framework of the project, which is supported by more than MNT 540 million from the ""Unitel"" Group, the experts of the Youth Development Center are being prepared as trainers, providing a basic understanding of electronics, ""Electrokid"" training on micro-programming Arduino board, robot assembling and coding programming courses. The establishment of Digital hubs at the youth development centre of the province started in 2022 with the first hub being established in Darkhan-Uul province. Further 12 hubs were established in 2023 in 12 provinces. In 2024, the hubs will be established in other provinces and some remote districts of Ulaanbaatar.","151280","151280","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

With Child Development Centers, 67 children with disabilities were able to enroll and access to education in four schools in UNICEF target areas. A Mobile Teacher initiative reached out 75 CWDs providing home-based educational service. UNICEF continues advocating for the importance of meaningful stimulation and early childhood development. As part of its efforts, national ECD service providers were equipped with child-centered interactions skills to support the implementation of the Inclusive Early Childhood Development strategy and ECD programme for 0-3 years old children upon its approval. UNICEF also focuses on active involvement of parents in ECD, including establishment of parenting clubs in 10 kindergartens in the focus areas. Over 70 master trainers monitored the parenting club operation the focus areas and collected information on good practices and lessons learned shared from a youth group and grandparents’ group in other provinces. UNICEF Mongolia continued its support in early screening of 9, 18 and 36 month old children and conducted a Training of Trainers for 21 provinces and supported training of 290 health workers in the focus areas in October-November 2022. All family health centers in the target four provinces have been equipped with necessary toys, books and tools to conduct the health and developmental check-up of children. Four ECE centers have improved kitchen and WASH facilities in the target areas in collaboration with nutrition and WASH teams. Hand washing and Health and Hygiene campaign was conducted in collaboration with Wash Action NGO. A team from the Mongolian National University of Education conducted an end-line survey on improving the quality of the 24-hour service project. The survey revealed 85 % of the targeted kindergartens met the criteria of child-friendly services. The preschool enrollment rate increased by 7% in Bayanzurkh district through the establishment of child-friendly 24-hour kindergarten services. As a result of the adaption of a course on working with children in 24-hour kindergartens in the Mongolian National University of Education, the first 120 students completed the course and acquired knowledge and skills to support children in different socio-economic groups, parents on child development, and roles of kindergarten support staff members for better management of 24-hour kindergartens. In the upcoming years, 100-120 students will study this course annually. 280 trainers were trained for nationwide dissemination of training modules on “Nutrition education in kindergarten”, “Health education in kindergarten” and “Monitoring child development and school readiness”. Also, the training set for visiting teachers was developed including a handbook for teachers, and parents and a workbook for children. The visiting teachers contribute to supporting child development in families which are living in remote areas and practicing hybrid learning in the field of pre-school education. 150 teachers are being trained in inclusive education in collaboration with Authority of General Education.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

This will benefit around 2000 children over five years. During the reporting period, UNICEF supported a teacher exchange programme on inclusive education for 200 teachers (114 F) and five District Education Officers (02 F) from 48 schools with inclusive education programmes. Instantly 48 inclusive schools with 1253 students with disabilities plus other general learners and teachers will be benefitted. Progressively, 120 schools and over 100,000 students including learners with diverse background will be benefitted.To promote inclusive education UNICEF provided technical support to develop Standards for Inclusive Education in 2017. During the reporting period, 52 participants (9 F) received training on the Standards for Inclusive Education which included District/Municipality Education Officers, school principals, and officials from the MoESD, Bhutan Council for School Examinations and Assessments (BCSEA), Bhutan Qualification and Professional Certification Authority(BQPCA). The participants were equipped to use the inclusive education standards to bring about systemic changes in the existing and new inclusive schools, following a school-wide approach. Using the inclusive Education standards rubrics and indicators schools will be challenged to demonstrate progress in policy and practice and sustain inclusion as school culture. As a result of this training, children will enjoy greater accessibility in schools as well as learn better through inclusive practices.  48 schools catering to 1253 children will benefit from inclusive policy, practices and culture. In the long run all the 120 inclusive schools as well as all as the general 4schools will be benefitted.DPOB will hold a two-day orientation to 25-30 local government leaders of ten western districts on National Disability Policy as well as UNCRPD, using Disability Equality Training approach. With this all 20 districts' local government leaders would have received the orientation training. As result disability inclusion and advocacy on the national policy for persons with disabilities as well as UNCRPD will be mainstreamed into local governance planning. In the long run this will contribute to leaving no one behind and full social inclusion. a) The Monastic Education Council and Research (with Dratshang Lhentshog as the Secretariat) was to implement three activities from the Education Programme, as part of system transformation efforts. 1) Dratshang Management Information System (DMIS) initiated three years ago to be web-based and fully functional for data to be analysed and provided to endusers in the form of statistics book publication 2) Valiadation of disability data and identification of the needs of those monks and nuns identified with disabilities and 3) Development of an interactive teacher training package for inservice teachers. Fund could not be released for any of the three activities, as there was little progress on number 1, competent consultant could not be hired for number 2 and the context changed for number 3. The IP has reported that data is being collected manually to be populated in DMIS. Once the DMIS is up and running, data can be extracted, analysed and published for dissemination to the endusers. For number 2, the ToR must be revisted to capture te needs of persons identified with disabilities to plan interventions next year. Finally, the Monastic Education Council will be receiving trained teachers from MoESD and instead of training inservice teachers, the IP has requested to reprogramme the fund for developing English curriculum instead. All the three asticities to be moved/reprogrammed to 2025.b) The literacy programme, through the Akelius Language Initiative, has been rolled out in 10 additional monastic schools, including three nunneries in 2024. These 10 schools have been equipped with tablets, headphones, multi-charging stations, furniture, and projectors to facilitate language learning using the Aeklius digital language learning platform through a blended approach. The capacity of 22 (11 Female, 11 Male) English teachers, from these 10 schools have been built on classroom management, blended teaching, lesson plan development, pedagogy, Child Online Protection, and using the Akelius platform to teach English. 541 (131 Female, 384 Male) additionl monks and nuns are learning English through the Aeklius Language Initiative. Additionally, Eduten which is a mathematics learning platform from Finland has come forward to provide free access to their platform for six monastic schools including two nunneries. Hence, 588 children (48 F) and 14 adults (all female) are also learning mathematics using the Eduten platform.   c) An Integrated multi-sector child-friendly intervention was initiated in 3 monastic institutions, including one 1 nunnery, in 3 districts (Punakha, Zhemgang, Mongar), to improve conditions for 317 (23 F) children and young people and create a systemic change through building ownership among the key stakeholders and increasing investment for the holistic wellbeing and development of young monks and nuns.","1134870","907870","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Multiple guidelines were developed, and awareness-raising workshops were conducted. In 2023, four guidelines were created for parents/caregivers, teachers, and aid workers, focusing on DRR for children with hearing impairment, children on the autism spectrum, and children with physical disabilities. Additionally, various pilot consultative workshops were organized for diverse stakeholders involved in supporting CWD including MoE, IRCS, SWO and local NGOs, to test and finalize the content. Building on last year’s achievements in improving national screening programme coverage, UNICEF supported a systematic approach towards early detection, timely intervention, and referral of disability. As the backbone of this systematic approach, the Integrated Growth and Development (SIRAT is the acronym in Farsi) Data System was established by MoE and became functional. UNICEF supported the establishment and deployment of this data system, through procurement of server infrastructure and ICT equipment, necessary for a large-scale data system. Through the SIRAT Data System, a record for each student is created as they go through the school entrance screening programme, documenting their disability status, required support services, and monitoring their received interventions, referrals, etc. The main function of this system is to monitor and track provision of timely intervention for children with disabilities in inclusive mainstream schools. This year, at least 1,500,000 children were registered into this system. To support the progress of inclusive education and to promote the multiple aspects of inclusion, UNICEF translated a UNICEF global guideline on Inclusive Education (14 short booklets), and will share for the use of various stakeholders in the country.WHO: The health system was strengthened with development of self-care educational packages for people with disabilities and their caregivers, translation of WHO documents related to assistive technology including modules of Training in Assistive Products (TAP), facilitating access to access to Farsi version of electronic version of Caregivers Skills Training Program (e-CST), and development of a National Rehabilitation Strategic Action plan in Iran.UNFPA: no contribution in 2023 ","","",""," ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The disaster came at a time when the Government was still facing other protracted displacements in Mindanao including the Marawi conflict response. The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), with its field team, the Mindanao Humanitarian Team (MHT), led the prioritized response, engaging the leadership of the province, targeted municipalities and affected communities. LGUs’ role in the project was an example of a localized humanitarian support with strong collaboration among all actors in making key decisions that ensured implementation issues were responded to and tailored to the context. 

In the context of COVID-19, the interventions provided critical and life-saving support to the targeted beneficiaries of Pregnant  and Lactating Women, Women of Reproductive Age, Adolescents including girls, PWDs, Indigenous People (IPs) and IDPs. 

The 1,000 Pregnant Women targeted in earthquake-affected municipalities (Kidapawan - 516; Makilala - 319; and Tulunan - 165) received cash assistance at Two Thousand (P 2,000) Pesos each to support for 4 prenatal visits, facility based delivery and postpartum visits. They were  also provided with a maternity pack. Among the pregnant women, there were 174 adolescents (below 19 years old) and 826 WRA while 183 belonged to Indigenous People (IP).

The 50 GBV survivors and persons with severe psychosocial issues (Makilala: GBV-7 and Tulunan: GBV-29, MH-14) prioritizing women, adolescent girls, and children were provided Cash for Protection assistance amounting to Ten Thousand (P 10,000) Pesos each to be able to recover from the impact of disaster. Breakdowns for the 50 beneficiaries are as follows: 36 GBV survivors (5 males and 31 females) and 14 persons with severe psychosocial disorders (7 males and 7 females).  Among the recipients, 7 were Adolescents and 43 WRA; 2 PWDs, 1 Pregnant, and 11 belonged to Indigenous People (IP).

24 Radio Scripts on SRH, ASRH, GBV, MHPSS, and Young People's topic were designed and developed in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. UNFPA, its Implementing Partner Organization - the Mindanao Organization for Social and Economic Progress or MOSEP, MOH Family Health Cluster and MSSD in BARMM reviewed and approved the radio scripts.  A total of 58 radio prime time hours of radio program conducted and 257 radio spots or info-commercial played in 3 Radio Stations. Targeted groups and audiences were the Women of Reproductive Age (WRA), Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs) and Adolescents. The one-hour Radio Programming: live on radio stations, virtual live stream on Facebook and recorded were broadcasted simultaneously in covered and reached areas of NorthCot and BARMM. These were conducted in partnership with MOH and MSSD as anchors and speakers. The topics tackled on SRH: Safe Motherhood, Family Planning, Access and availability of SRH, Maternal and Child Health services in this COVID-19 pandemic; GBV: types of violence commonly experienced by women and girls in evacuation centers and at home and the availability of services, and established referral mechanisms; MHPSS: depression and coping mechanisms and mental illnesses during the pandemic. Also, the partner MOH and MSSD programs and services were among the topics discussed in the Radio Program. In the recently conducted BARMM IEC Evaluation (2020), around 50% provided multiple responses and claimed that they have heard topics related to ASRH and Maternal Health, GBV and MHPSS through radio programs and spots. The cumulative reach for Radio-Based IEC in Mindanao is around 302,398 individuals.

The one (1) monitoring and evaluation activity conducted by the hired service provider was used to inform the effectiveness of the BARMM IEC activities and for further enhancement of the BARMM Radio-Based IEC programming to promote and ensure key information and quality services even  in emergency settings.

The challenge is that curriculum developers often lack the knowledge and skills to develop learning and assessment materials pertaining to higher-level qualifications.
Currently there are no national guidelines to assist curriculum developers with aligning curricula to national competency standards at higher standards (NC3) and few professional development opportunities for curriculum developers.  Furthermore, despite a clear need to help those without formal qualifications to have their skills and training recognised through RPL, there are no clear processes and approaches to align the structure and inherent logic of RPL to curriculum development.
The TVET intervention encompasses:
-	Development of a guideline or checklist to support the development of curricula for NC3, which forms a structural basis for RPL

UNFPA supported DSHE to develop a Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Guideline for Secondary schools which will be disseminated nationally in 2023. Additionally, 171 secondary schools in three targeted districts have functional anti-sexual harassment committees to ensure a gender-transformative and sexual harassment-free school environment. UNFPA developed an evidence-based ECM message focusing on the causes and demerits of child marriage and response hotline numbers and disseminated to beneficiaries in three flood-affected districts. UNFPA also developed an SBCC strategy to end child marriage for MOWCA, Girls Not Brides (GNB), and IPs and provided orientation on the SBCC strategy to 40 participants including IP staff and Girls Not Brides members. 22 community-based and grassroots-level organizations from 6 districts also received capacity development training to deliver SBCC strategy in six target districts.","1503498","1563498","1550963","In 2023, MoWCA, with technical assistance from UNFPA and UNICEF, developed and finalised the ME Framework and a strategic costing of the National Action Plan to Eliminate Child Marriage (NAPECM) in collaboration with relevant ministries. The ME Framework will support the effective implementation and monitoring of the NAP-ECM. In addition, District Action Plans to end child marriage have been developed and endorsed by four UNFPA priority districts (Jamalpur, Sirajgonj, Patuakhali and Bagerhaat). These plans will help implement the National Action Plan to End Child Marriage at the local level. ﻿In 2023, comprehensive Sexuality Education was delivered to 19,378 adolescent girls, including 9,082 married adolescents and 10,296 adolescent girls actively involved throughout the year at Kishori Resource Centres located in the UNFPA-supported priority locations. Moreover, UNFPA has developed a tailored Comprehensive Sexuality Education curriculum for out-of-school adolescent girls, including components for married adolescent girls. UNFPA also effectively engaged and supported 30 youth-led and women-led community-based organizations (CBOs) across six UNFPA-supported districts, empowering them to advocate against child marriage and promote gender equality. This approach resulted in the formation of local coalitions and networks, reaching 15,600 community members through social and behavioural change interventions. In 2023, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs adopted the career guide handbook, developed with the support of UNFPA, and started using it in 4883 Kishor Kishori Clubs, run by MoWCA, reaching 146,490 adolescents across the country.3,108 government officials (district administration officials, district and sub-district level CMPC members, journalists, marriage registrars, and school teachers) at the national and sub-national levels in six UNFPA-supported districts were trained to implement and monitor CRMA 2017, NAP ECM and other relevant policies/guidelines at the district level. ﻿School campaigns were conducted by the Department of Women Affairs in 98 schools in six UNFPA-supported districts to promote gender-transformative and harassment-free education environments at schools, reaching 18,465 students, including 10,068 female adolescent students.","1471000","1264740","775694","UNFPA supported 2,706 life skills education sessions across Bagerhat, Chapainawabganj, and Cox's Bazar, reaching 27,880 adolescent girls with essential knowledge and skills. A whole-of-society approach was adopted to shift harmful gender and social norms and strengthen protection services:  District-level action plans to end child marriage were implemented, engaging the education, health, and social protection sectors. Local governments, community-based organisations, and district administrations received capacity-building support to implement and monitor evidence-based interventions. Essential protection services, particularly gender-based violence response mechanisms, were strengthened in priority districts. UNFPA worked closely with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) to enhance the legal and policy framework supporting adolescent girls' rights. UNFPA also advocated for reforms to the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017, securing government buy-in to initiate the amendments. The Department of Women Affairs (DWA) of MoWCA, with UFNPA support, integrated the Norm-Shift Accelerator program with two of the largest social protection programs, reaching over a million families in Bangladesh. 279 NGOs across 64 districts, many of them women-led, were engaged under the Norm-Shift Accelerator Programme, strengthening grassroots capacity to drive social norms change. Through the  Vulnerable Women Benefit Programme, 300,000 women at the grassroots level participated in value deliberation sessions within their communities, equipping them with tools to challenge harmful gender norms linked to child marriage. This integrated approach addressed both poverty and normative drivers of child marriage, contributing to a more holistic, scalable, and sustainable solution.Gender Promoters and VWB NGO trainers conducted 58,638 sessions, reaching 17,964  beneficiaries of the Vulnerable Women Benefit (VWB) programme. A post-test study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the interventions to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, with findings expected in 2025. To further inspire adolescent girls, UNFPA launched ""Shombhabonar Utshob"" (The Festival of Potential) in Bagerhat and Cox's Bazar, engaging 1,100 adolescent girls and their families in career festivals and intergenerational dialogues. UNFPA facilitated the development and implementation of four district multisectoral action plans to address child marriage in Jamalpur, Sirajganj, Patuakhali, and Bagerhat in line the National Action Plan to End Child Marriage. In 2024, 23 key GBV and health cluster organizations unified their understanding of the need to address child marriage, ensuring that interventions are sensitive to the unique risks faced by girls. This effort is expected to benefit an average of 39,069 women and girls annually through integrated services at national and local levels. 604 committee members of two district-level and fifteen Upazila-level Child Marriage Prevention Committees were trained and sensitised in Bagerhat, Chapainawabganj and Cox’s Bazar. This aims to strengthen their understanding of child marriage laws and policies and enhance their capacity to effectively operate CMPCs.UNFPA also facilitated gender-transformative dialogues and consensus-building with key influencers, including 162 marriage registrars and religious leaders in the community to address child marriage and promote the rights of adolescent girls. These dialogues resulted in a commitment from these key influencers to cooperate in child marriage prevention efforts. It was agreed that UNOs, Gender Promoters, and Women Affairs Officers would ensure continuous monitoring of marriage registrars. 164 community matchmakers participated in value clarification sessions, leading to a pledge to stop facilitating child marriages in Bagerhat and Cox’s Bazaar.

Key Components of SAEP include trauma-informed approaches to address stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges faced by adolescent girls due to forced marriage and early pregnancies. Peer-led mentoring networks help create safe spaces for girls to discuss their concerns, share experiences, and collectively support each other in resisting harmful practices. In terms of Community Engagement and Social Norms Change the visibility of adolescent girls in sports and leadership roles has shifted community perceptions on gender roles, increasing acceptance of girls' participation in public life.

The purpose is to establish a forum for information exchange, sharing best practices and issues; and facilitating integration of approaches to advance teacher development and support in a coordinated manner. 5 meetings were held, resulting in a joint roadmap for mutual support, accountability, and coherence in teacher development. However, due to lack of funding from the de-facto MoE for learning assessment and training of teachers on the same, the development of a standardized system for classroom-based assessment remains in its infancy.  Despite challenges related to lack of funding from the de-facto MoE, combined with the ongoing ban on secondary level girls’ education above Grade 6, further preparation work to roll-out system strengthening activities for teaching quality was carried out, including strengthening the technical collaboration and working relationship with the de-facto MoE’s Teacher Professional Development Directorate (TPD). An integrated training package was developed, bringing together training and preparation of teachers, headteachers, academic supervisors, and school management shuras (SMS) for improved teaching to enhance learning. This integrated package aims at creating an enabling environment to improve teaching and learning at the school level. To this end, a 10-day modular teacher training course was developed. Once the teachers attend the training courses, the integrated training package entails coordinated actions from the headteachers, SMSs, and academic supervisors to create a supportive environment for teachers to implement change. In 2022, this approach was piloted in 4 provinces: 476 (336 male, 140 female) teachers were reached so far, whereas other courses will start early next year.

While UNESCO overall coordinated and supported Ministry of Education in the preparation of report and compendium of Education policies and programmes in G 20 countries, UNICEF drafted and lead the chapter on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy(FLN). UNICEF as the knowledge partner for  the Ministry of Education for G20 on foundational learning, leveraged to advocate for increased global focus on the importance foundational literacy and numeracy and highlighted the global and Indian best experience through representation and presentations in all the four education working group meetings, exhibitions and seminars. UNICEF supported NITI in development of education sector module including the preparation of outline and overall framework, the base presentation to facilitate roll out of Aspirational Blocks Programme led by NITI .   UNICEF’s supported in preparation of 17 state equity profiles and shared with state governments to strengthen evidence based planning of education sector( Samagra Shiksha) with a improved focus on education interventions for children of disadvantaged/vulnerable/marginalized communities. Learning assessment data coupled with gender and equity analysis of key educational indicators enhanced state education functionaries’ capacities in the use of data and evidence in the state education sector planning process and in ensuring targeted interventions for the children of disadvantaged and vulnerable communities including children with disabilities for improved access and learning. UNICEFs technical support to Ministry of Education and National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in the dissemination of findings of FLS and NAS 2021 has enhanced states’ understanding of evidence on student learning at state and district level.Through a joint roundtable with National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on the implementation of the 2021 national assessment survey (NAS) with national stakeholders, lessons learnt discussed to increased understanding for improved implementation for the next NAS in 2024.  Eight states have initiated for establishing early warning systems (EWS) for identifying children at risk of dropping out from schools. For example, in Uttar Pradesh, 8,213 government schools in four districts identified children at risk and kept them in school. Gujarat has developed a model by using AI that predicts students at risk of dropping.  UNICEF technical support to state governments in the developments of guidance documents, modules, standard operating procedures, and courses led to 12 states enhanced implementing of comprehensive school safety programme through 101,706 (40% female) trained education functionaries and integrating elements of climate change specifically in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu  Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal","1500000","1289877","1289877","UNICEF delivered significant results for children in education, with a focus on equity, inclusivity, and innovation.

These reports which focused on gender and equity analysis of key educational indicators enhanced state education functionaries’ capacities in the use of data and evidence in preparation of evidence-based state education sector plans and in ensuring targeted interventions for the children of disadvantaged and vulnerable communities including children with disabilities for improved access and learning. Developed in Power BI, the report highlights issue of low access, retention and learning proficiency especially at secondary level and among marginalized groups together shortage of teachers in some states. These efforts ensured targeted interventions for marginalized groups, including children with disabilities and leveraged USD 213 million in domestic financing  UNICEFs continued technical support to development of guidance documents and training of education functionaries led to 12 states effectively implementing comprehensive school safety programme (CSSP) and capacity of 121,057 education functionaries was strengthened to integrate elements of climate change into CSSP and  a national teacher training module on climate change is being finalized by NCERT with UNICEF support.    UNICEF supported state governments to develop digital learning strategies or roadmaps. In Assam, a comprehensive digital learning strategy was initiated in partnership with SmSA and relevant departments. Jammu  Kashmir revised its 'Roadmap on Digital Transformation of Education,' addressing EdTech integration and cybersecurity. Kerala's model of early IT adoption in education serves as a benchmark for others. As a result of this work, UNICEF India has developed a national strategy on digital learning for the next five years and convened a multistakeholder national consultation governments, civil society, UN agencies, and the private sector to receive feedback on the strategy and to drive the agenda on digital pedagogy and the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence in education.

Systematic data collection and reporting of teacher vaccinations and of school reopening was an important result for 2021. This was achieved through UNICEF providing timely and targeted technical assistance to MOECRT and the MOH. As a result, these two significant and interrelated matters, fundamental to COVID-19 recovery, were closely monitored and tracked, which directly informed programming. In parallel to this work, UNICEF education and health teams worked in collaboration to inform the development of a safe return to learning decree and guidelines, which shaped the school reopening process in the country. Working both with the MOECRT and MOH has enabled good practice decisions to be made about school opening, in a way that was evidence-based. UNICEF continued to provide technical advice and to advocate on critical matters as part of the Government’s preparation of a revised decree, which will guide school opening from January 2022 onwards.
To promote and facilitate children’s safe return to school, teacher vaccination and to tackle potential COVID-19 impacts on out-of-school children, UNICEF assisted MOECRT in a ‘keep safe, keep learning’ campaign with the production of campaign materials, such as public service announcements through TV, radio and social media. The national campaign, which is ongoing, reached approximately 24.3 million people in 2021, through various social media channels.
An evaluation of the Comprehensive School Safety (CSS) programme, undertaken with UNICEF assistance, was finalized in 2021. One of the keys finding from this research is that CSS implementation in Indonesia has typically focused on disaster management at the school level and mitigation and disaster risk reduction, with fewer institutions engaged in improvements to facilities and infrastructure. This means that schools in Indonesia are very vulnerable to being heavily damaged when natural disasters occur.
As part of technical assistance to develop policy to strengthen CSS implementation, UNICEF provided technical advice to inform drafting of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) umbrella decree on safe schools. A new revision on the National Safe School guidance has been updated, underscoring the climate change risks and impacts as an important factor that affects disasters, to be considered by schools. Capacity building and support to national and subnational governments continued, including efforts to establish a Safe School Secretariat (SPAB) in Central Java and East Java provinces as part of emergency preparedness for the education sector coordination, effectively meeting the two targeted districts for 2021. This ongoing support was strengthened by close and regular coordination with the National Education Cluster, led by the MOECRT.
To support adolescent participation and empowerment in the context of COVID-19, UNICEF’s Adolescent Kit was rolled-out with a focus on disadvantaged areas. The Education Section has focused on Central Java Sulawesi, and Papua. The Kit supports adolescent girls and boys to develop 10 key competences. They work in teams to identify issues affecting them and develop their own prototype solutions. UNICEF is currently planning the procurement of an additional 110 Adolescent Kits to provide adolescent-responsive resources during emergencies, natural disasters and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

","185128","510208","510208","UNICEF:UNICEF provided capacity building to the National Safe School Secretariat on education in emergencies and comprehensive school safety matters, which led to the national secretariat conducting outreach to several provinces to assist in the establishment of provincial-level Safe School Secretariats (SPAB), including initial budget allocations to support the functions of these new groups. In 2022, eight additional provinces were reached, namely North Sulawesi, East Kalimantan, Aceh, NTT, Maluku, West Sumatera, Papua and West Papua, building on the two provinces that were supported in 2021 and making a cumulative total of 10 provinces receiving support to date.The issue of climate change was integrated into National Safe School guidance to support climate adaptation at the school level. This result was achieved through UNICEF technical assistance. Two knowledge and information products about climate change mitigation to reduce the impact on children and adolescent were developed, including: (1) National Safe School guidance for the reference of schools was updated in April 2022, underscoring climate change risks and impacts as important factors that affect disasters; and (2) the development of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials, including comic books and posters, with a focus on how to mitigate the impact of climate change. In response to the changing circumstances brought by COVID-19 and school operations, UNICEF provided timely and quality technical assistance to MoECRT for the development and revision of the joint safe return to learning decree and guideline, which were critical references for all schools across the country to ensure school and student safety. Additionally, UNICEF’s continuation of technical support for the systematic data collection and reporting of teacher vaccinations and school reopening was an important contribution for 2022. This was achieved through UNICEF providing timely and targeted technical assistance to MoECRT and MoH. However, the data collection was discontinued in October 2022, given all schools were re-opened and teacher vaccination had reached over 90 per cent.UNICEF supported several advocacy workshops to promote Safe School practices, including socialization to push for 100 per cent face-to-face learning, including the application of COVID-19 safety protocols by schools. The training and workshops were held in three provinces: Central Java, East Java and East Nusa Tenggara. To date, 8,113 teachers, local government officials, teacher associations and NGOs have been reached through online and offline Safe School training workshops.UNICEF continued to work in partnership with MoECRT to support the development of the Ministry’s national Safe Return to Learning campaign. Campaign materials developed in partnership with the ministry reached wide audiences through mass media and social media, press releases and op-ed articles, public service announcements (PSAs), radio, video and an advocacy and guideline video. The estimated reach was 21.6 million people through TV and 19 million through social media","2085442","13951","13951","UNICEFDespite significant progress in 2021-2022 when 10 provinces were assisted to develop CSS plans and regulations, limited resources/funding partners has hampered acceleration and scale-up of the Safe School (Comprehensive School Safety) programme and climate-change specific activities in the education sector. No additional provinces received support on education in emergencies (EiE) and comprehensive school safety matters in 2023.   Working with the EiE cluster at the national level, UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (MoECRT) to participate in the mid-term review of the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 event in May 17-18, 2023 at UN HQ. UNICEF, together with EiE cluster members, has significantly contributed to the revision of the National Safe School guideline and the development of the Child Friendly Comprehensive School Safety modules. The latter are now easier to comprehend as they were created in consultation with children.The UNICEF education programme now has a greater focus on advancing climate change education for preparedness and resilience of children and young people, and during 2023 it prepared a comprehensive climate change proposal encompassing these key areas. In 2023, we also proactively sought financing opportunities for our climate change agenda and supported MoECRT’s contribution to the EiE global report: Leveraging Education in Emergencies for Climate ActionIndonesia, a nation prone to natural disasters, faces the constant challenge of ensuring emergency preparedness and adequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. In this context, UNICEF continue to support in the enhancement of country's response capabilities, integrating climate resilience and fostering collaborative efforts across various stakeholders.One of UNICEF's key interventions has been the support in activating the cluster coordination mechanism during emergencies. This proactive approach ensures better response to the most marginalized communities with most appropriate interventions.Furthermore, UNICEF has actively collaborated with the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) and the Ministry of Health to ensure the immediate availability of critical emergency supplies. This includes pre-positioning of water purification tablets, hygiene kits, and other essential items, maximizing efficiency and minimizing response time during emergencies.After Action Review of the WASH sub-cluster’s response in Cianiur paved the way for more effective future intervention by identifying areas for improvement Through this review, UNICEF shared lessons learn from past experiences and suggestions for further improvement   ed with stakeholders including government departments and WASH Sub-cluster members..Effective communication and coordination are essential for successful emergency response. In Cianjur, UNICEF promoted the use of the 4W form, a standardized tool that tracks who is doing what, where, and when. This not only enhanced collaboration within the WASH Sub-cluster but also ensured clarity and avoided duplication of efforts.Recognizing the need for clear roles and responsibilities, UNICEF advocated for the clarification of the ministry responsible for WASH Sub-cluster coordination and the designation of a focal point. This crucial step will help streamlining communication and accountability, enabling a more coordinated and efficient response.Beyond immediate response, UNICEF is committed to long-term improvements. In this regard, 144 primary health centres (Puskesmas) are being supported to upgrade their WASH facilities and implement proper infection prevention and control practices. This proactive catalytic investment in healthcare infrastructure protects both patients and staff from waterborne diseases, contributing to a healthier and more resilient community.These diverse initiatives, encompassing climate-conscious planning, collaborative partnerships, improved communication, and infrastructure development, demonstrate UNICEF's unwavering commitment to strengthen Indonesia's emergency preparedness and WASH response. By building a more resilient future, UNICEF is empowering communities to face challenges with greater preparedness and access to critical WASH services, ultimately safeguarding the health and well-being of all Indonesians.UNICEF continued to support the Directorate of Nutrition and Maternal Child Health and the Ministry of Health in their role as leads of nutrition sub-cluster. As part of the support to strengthen the government response to various disasters, UNICEF completed the development of nutrition in emergency response booklets targeted at health workers in Primary Health Care and humanitarian actors. The booklets were launched and disseminated to representatives from all 38 provinces and selected districts in November 2023.UNICEF also provided technical support to the government in scaling up the end-users’ training on NiE in more than 10 provinces using the accredited curricula developed by UNICEF and the Ministry of Health. All these activities have helped the government increase the number of health workers equipped with the knowledge and skills to respond to emergencies across the country.In close partnership with the MOH and relevant partners, UNICEF has provided support to the national and sub-national levels to strengthen the capacity of the health sector in the management of disaster and public health crises. UNICEF is also supporting health facilities to improve capacity to prepare, respond, and recover from health crises. Working closely with the Directorate of Referral Healthcare Services, UNICEF is also supporting health facilities to have improved capacity to prepare, respond, and recover from health crises. A series of training on child in emergency management at referral health facilities was conducted, involving more than 60 general practitioners, nurses, and midwives as a team. Some profession associations, hospitals, and the private sector provided medical equipment for simulation training for these activities.Working in close coordination with the MOH Health Crisis Center, UNICEF is providing technical support to strengthen data and information systems at the national level. Technical support is also provided for the development of modules on the management of health crises and ongoing support is provided to develop contingency plans at selected provincial levels. In collaboration with the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC)-Atlanta and the UNICEF Regional Office, and other professional associations, UNICEF Indonesia conducted a series of capacity building sessions for emergency teams at national and sub-national levels. Universities, CSOs, and the emergency team of army took part, this involved more than 200 participants. UNICEF continues to provide technical support to various COVID-19 responses and potential future disruptions, including providing health supplies and 190 makeshift tents for emergency hospitals, these were distributed to the ten cluster offices of Health Crisis Center across the country.UNICEF advocated for the engagement and leadership of the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection (MoWECP) with the National Cluster for Protection and Displacement and the National Sub-Cluster on Child Protection. During the National Workshop on the Review of the National Cluster System in October 2023, led by the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture (KEMENKO PMK) and the National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana - BNPB), MoWECP confirmed its interest to participate in the review of the Regulation of the Ministry of Social Affairs No. 26 of 2015 on the Guidelines for Coordination for Protection and Displacement Cluster. During the workshop, MoWECP confirmed that the Protection and Displacement Clusters as well as the Child Protection sub-cluster mechanisms would integrate with MoWECP’s mandate for the coordination for child protection components (which also covers children in need of special protection) at national and sub-national levels.UNICEF also continue to engage with the Interagency Working Group on Information Management (IM Working Group) to advocate and update the 4W (who is doing what, where and when) tools for child protection, which help avoid duplication of efforts and identify gaps for informed programming during humanitarian crises. The revised tools were tested by sub-cluster members during the Central Sulawesi earthquake response in 2019. The IM Working Group, led by UNOCHA, together with technical specialists from UN agencies, IFRC, Indonesian Red Cross and humanitarian NGOs supported BNPB and sectoral ministries to improve the management and information system, including for 4W tools. The adoption of the tools will strengthen coordination mechanisms, including for child protection.Following the launch of the Guideline on Child-Focused Contingency Plan, UNICEF continued to advocate for the use of the guideline by MoWECP in its support to provincial governments in developing child-focused emergency contingency plans. MoWECP was a member of the technical team and steering committee for the development of the guideline, which was developed under the leadership of BNPB with support of UNICEF Indonesia. The guidelines include prevention and response to violence, abuse and exploitation, and to gender-based violence in emergency contexts and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).With support from MoWECP, governments in Makassar City, Gowa District and Maros District have established intersectoral teams on the protection of children and women as part of sub-national clusters in South Sulawesi, building on the training delivered by RedR with UNICEF support in 2022. In Makassar, the trained team members engaged in raising awareness on preparedness on child protection in at-risk villages. The awareness-raising activities were linked to local community-based integrated child protection mechanisms (Perlindungan Anak Terpadu Berbasis Masyarakat - PATBM), including UNICEF-supported Safe and Friendly Environment for Children (SAFE4C) villages.UNICEF also supported UNHCR with BID processes for 15 (8 girls; 7 boys) refugee unaccompanied separated children. BID is a procedure where refugees and other vulnerable children benefit from individual needs assessments to identify their prospects, thus safeguarding their rights and well-being and ensuring that refugee children are facilitated for better options. -----","5385","5385","5385","UNICEF:Limited resources and funding hampered the acceleration and scale up of the Safe School (Comprehensive School Safety - CSS) programme and climate change-specific activities in the education sector. No additional provinces received support on education in emergencies (EiE) and CSS matters in 2024. Ten provinces – East Java, Central Java, North Sulawesi, East Kalimantan, Aceh, NTT, Maluku, West Sumatera, Papua, and West Papua – were supported by UNICEF in the initial years of the country programme (2021-2022). Working with the EiE cluster at the national level, UNICEF provided technical assistance, in collaboration with other EiE cluster members, for the implementation of CSS and EiE, including the production of the following communication, information and education (CEI) assets: a Youth Volunteer Handbook for Education in Emergencies, the printing and distribution of the revised National Safe School guideline to 10 provinces, which also includes a component of climate change education. Climate change is now integrated into disaster risk assessments. Notably, this includes its integration into resilience and disaster risk education through the current Merdeka Belajar curriculum, encompassing topics such as climate change mitigation and environmental preservation. This integration aligns with the climate change curriculum guideline launched by the Ministry of Education in August 2024. The updated Safe School Guidelines address gender-specific vulnerabilities regarding gender-based violence in emergency situations. These guidelines ensure that both girls and boys are equally prepared for and safe from harm during disasters, while acknowledging their unique needs and contributions.

In 2023, the program focused on scale up to ensure maximum number of young people could take advantage of the program.In these sessions, young people have applied to 4000+ relevant jobs matching their skills and interest. Career/Employment awareness sessions: With the objective of enhancing young people’s understanding of the job market and providing them with the latest information regarding various in-demand jobs, 30+ live sessions were conducted. These sessions saw participation of over 100,000 youth who also interacted with the experts through live chat box. YuWaah, through its partners, IGNOU and Alohomora Foundation also launched a new series to support youth in making them job ready by using AI tools effectively. These focus on creating a resume, preparing for interviews, and introducing them to other AI tools. Systems Strengthening on the National Career Service (NCS) portal- Yuwaah continued to do the system strengthening work with MoLE on the NCS portal to ensure that young people can navigate the portal smoothly. This was accomplished through instructional videos enabling value added services like employment awareness and job support programs for NCS users, and promoting job fairs. 4 million new job seekers were onboarded NCS this year.In partnership with UNICEF/YuWaah, the ILO has launched the Skills Innovation Challenge Call in India with a theme of “Upgrading informal apprenticeships through digital transformation” in July 2023.","596710","580043","580043","UNDPUNDP’s technical support partnership with JSDM in skilling programmes resulted in over 101,100 youth (73% women) acquiring new skills and over 47,500+ (75% women) job placements.

In partnership with the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST) and IndusInd Bank, YuWaah is supporting the creation of 1,500 entrepreneurs and 2,000 mentors over three years in five aspirational districts across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan. With USD 1.9 million in unlocked funding, this initiative has the potential to create 150,000 jobs over the next three years. To explore innovative models for youth-led micro-entrepreneurship, YuWaah partnered with Jeevan Marga Charitable trust and LetsEndorse to pilot a program in scientific beekeeping under the National Beekeeping Mission. With the potential to create 20 million livelihoods, this initiative is currently training 500 young people across Jharkhand and Odisha, equipping them with technical skills, access to credit, and a guaranteed market over one year. In collaboration with Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, YuWaah is co-developing a national level entrepreneurship challenge for urban self-help groups. Designed as a scalable initiative, the challenge will provide grants and structured mentorship to promising SHG-led businesses in urban areas. YuWaah has received a formal endorsement from MoHUA to advance this collaboration. Further strengthening entrepreneurship pathways, YuWaah conceptualized Imagen Venture, an end-to-end platform supporting young entrepreneurs aged 18 and above from ideation to business development. The first phase of technology and content development has been completed, with two state governments (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) aligned to support the top ideas.

To expand the program going forward, in 2023, UNHCR and A4U scoped educational options in the Pacific, strengthened feedback channels with refugees, and developed a theory of change. In particular, the Office identified a need for short-term courses, vocational training and language courses, all geared at facilitating quicker integration into the workforce and communities. Following outreach with educational institutes across the Pacific, a Fijian university provided free online English courses to asylum-seekers and refugees in Fiji. Overall, the language support and changes to the Scholarship Program model have reduced barriers for entry into the program for 2024, and groundwork has been prepared to further improve refugees’ access to tertiary and vocational training in Fiji.","","","","","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

UNICEF focused on engaging with children through local Children’s Clubs in Uva, Eastern, and Northern Provinces, specifically targeting villages with conflict history and selecting children from various ethnic groups. As a result of UNICEF’s programmes, 1,236 children now have increased awareness and critical insights into the detrimental impacts of online/offline violence and hate speech and are equipped with the skills to identify and counter it. UNICEF ensured that children participating in the programme were active in their communities and online to further amplify the impact. For instance, at the community level, members of Children’s Clubs led the design of village-level social action projects that promoted responsible citizenship and positive engagement with peers, while online, they created positive narratives that fostered the use of positive messages instead of hate speech in the context of inter-communal discussions. UNICEF also engaged with religious leaders from the four major religions, mobilizing and training 156 religious leaders on the prevention of hate speech, resulting in their advocacy for positive social change within their communities. An additional 251 religious leaders received awareness of the harmful impacts of corporal punishment, contributing to their strong commitment to making religious schools free from corporal punishment.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Additionally, UNESCO supported trainings of journalists with a specific focus on digital security and the safety of women journalists.","","1300517","704355","STFA: The project is designed specially to support journalists to keep their profession and report writing and to provide access to information to the public. The project activities focused on crucial topics such as humanitarian aid and needs, access to education with a specific emphasis on girls' education, and local-level conflicts.Under the STFA project, UNESCO has received 211,350 USD and all of the received budget is committed and the IPs have started the implementation. STFA also allocated 450,000 USD to support Afghan media till the end of 2024 but till now UNESCO has not received the budget.Major challenges during the reporting period:The media-supporting projects are not severely affected by the current situation and bans and have been faced with various challenges like lack of access to information, lack of female media workers in southern Afghanistan, censorship, and security risks.WPFD: celebrated in ten provinces of Afghanistan, with the participation of 476 people, including journalists, media officials, media support organizations, scholars, and cultural figures and stakeholders. Keeping in mind the current repressing environment, notably, 47 female journalists and media workers also participated in the program.Twelve newly graduated students have been given the opportunity of six months of practical journalism training in production, presenting, report writing, technical/studio equipment uses, and new journalistic skills.Enhanced the skills and knowledge of 120 journalists all over Afghanistan to report on conflict prevention, resolution and peacebuilding in Afghanistan. The project aimed to train journalists from different media outlets on how to cover conflict-sensitive issues, promote dialogue and reconciliation, and avoid inciting violence or spreading hate speech. Additionally, a peace reporting guideline has been developed, printed and distributed. (The project is going to be completed by the end of August.)IPDC: CI recently received a grant of 25,000 USD under the IPDC Project and will be started by the end of JulyEU: This project focuses on the Afghan Media Resilience to Foster Peace and Security. Around 19 additional commercial media outlets consisting (of local Radios and TVs) will be on board by mid-year 2023.The progress of the EU-supported project has been steady and consistent. The results up to date are tangible and measurable. The funds utilized on target media outlets have changed their operational status from collapsing to a stabilizing position. The target media outlets are coping with the difficult financial situation by delivering the obligated services and producing relevant content which allows them to receive finances from this project against the services they deliver to the public through their established media platforms.The first phase of the EU/UNESCO project was mainly focused on providing technical and financial assistance to not-for-profit media outlets including media entities, civil society organizations, and NGOs. While the second phase is dedicated to the commercial media (Profit-making) media outlets consist of commercial TV and Radio outlets. The implementing partners of phase one of the project (None profit media outlets) are already on-board and performing their services, while IPs for phase 2 (commercial media/for-profit media organizations) are yet to be selected.Major challenges during the reporting period:- The need on the ground is bigger than the assistance we provide through the EU project. The demand is huge and the current aid cannot accommodate all the needs of the vulnerable media outlets.- Media in Afghanistan is still under the scrutiny of DFAs and they have not regained their media independence, editorial freedom, and access to information.

UNICEF support as Grant and Coordinating agency in sector coordination, monitoring and reporting resulted in initiation of policy reform efforts on continuity of learning, ECE, ALP/NFE and school clustering. UNICEF support strengthened provincial EMIS for key decision-making.  
UNICEF played a significant role in improving sector coordination and systems strengthening during the reporting period. This includes technical assistance in the development, finalization and management of large-scale sector wide strategic programmes for GPE and EU funding of US$ 116 million for three provinces as well as accompanying the implementation of sector budget support programme through focused technical assistance and service delivery modelling in Sindh province. The latter includes upgrading the data systems, development and implementation of school clustering policy and strengthening annual planning processes including robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms.  
UNICEF also played a significant role in strategic discussions at federal and provincial levels and small-scale piloting related to no-, low- and high-tech learning modalities and platforms for continuity of learning during the pandemic and building system resilience. This includes support to the landscape analysis for technology facilitated learning tools in Pakistan as well as direct support to Sindh education department for development of an implementation plan for digital learning solutions which also helped secure US$1 million in funding for 2021 and 2022. 
As key technical partner, UNICEF also co-convened and supported policy and planning decisions regarding scale up of ECE, ALP/NFE and designing of critical systematic frameworks for improving foundational literacy and numeracy at primary level.

UNICEF continued its integrated approach to the COVID-19 education response, which enabled many schools to be better prepared to provide a welcoming and safe environment after school reopening.  

This intersectoral approach was managed and monitored through the UNICEF Pakistan COVID-19 Taskforce with focus on operationalization at Field Office level. Continued support was provided to federal and provincial governments for the COVID-19 response at all levels, from a coordinating and convening role in technical working groups to roll-out of guidelines and SOPs for safe school reopening, capacity building and training of education officials, teachers and communities and service delivery and accompanying community mobilization and RCCE messaging and campaigns.  
To mitigate learning losses during school closures, UNICEF contributed to remote learning programs, both through direct service delivery (211,112 children (50 per cent girls) accessed offline remote learning modalities), investment in new digital learning models (Learning Passport), and evidence generation on digital learning models for strategy development in 2022 (Edtech Hub’s Mapping of Digital Learning Landscape). 
UNICEF continued to contribute to education sector coordination in its role as Education Sector Working Group (ESWG) lead and provided leadership and quality assurance of critical ESWG outputs, including the education component of RRPs with UNHCR for possible influx of Afghan refugees; the development of an Education Cannot Wait Multi-Year Resilience Program (US$13 million seed funding within a US$60 million portfolio); and conducting provincial EiE trainings with Save the Children for 94 government and CSO staff (37 female). 
In contribution to capacity building for accelerated education in the education sector and to promote approaches meeting international standards, UNICEF and JICA in cooperation with the inter-agency Accelerated Education Working Group (AEWG), conducted two Accelerated Education -focused webinars reaching more than 150 practitioners, including provincial and national government officials.

An analysis and summary of a draft KAP was completed, with actionable insights for the national C4D strategic framework for the upcoming UNICEF Country Programme. Synthesis and documentation of good practices, results, and lesson learnt of the ‘Every Child in School Initiative” which ended mid-2016 is in process. 
In terms of capacity building and system strengthening, provincial education departments in Punjab, Sindh, KP and FATA were supported to develop communication strategies. In Sindh, UNICEF as Coordinating Agency for the GPE supported the Education Department to develop a strategy for effective communication through electronic media with stakeholders and communities, including a complaint management system. In Punjab, an orientation workshop on Behaviour and Social Change Communication with district education managers prepared the ground for future development of a BSSC capacity enhancement strategy. Also, capacities to implement the Punjab Enrolment and Retention Plan were strengthened through divisional level workshops with education district staff, principals and teachers, along with software to collect OOSC data provided to the education department. 

UNICEF supported Departments of Education in enrolment campaigns in all four provinces and FATA, with focus on girls’ enrolment. In 2017, an estimated 740,000 children (40 per cent girls) enrolled in the early grades of government schools in 50 focus districts and FATA, of which an estimated 10-15 percent may not have enrolled without the interventions. In FATA, this was the first enrolment campaign, successfully mobilising government, community leaders and members, in a context of return and recovery. Through the campaign, provisional numbers show 126,000 children (35 per cent girls) newly enrolled against a target of 200,000. Although enrolment drives and social mobilization efforts are successful in enrolling more children, dropout/retention remains a challenge. As part of government programs to provide learning opportunities to over-age and disadvantaged children, nearly 26,000 children and adolescents (46 per cent girls) were enrolled in 559 ALP classes in urban slums (Karachi) and disadvantaged rural areas (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab) with direct UNICEF support. Approximately 51,000 children and youth (48 per cent girls) in government schools and ALP centres participated in co-curricular activities that improved education quality and social cohesion competencies. 

Community led activities led to increased engagement of local education councils and parent teacher school management committees for effective school functioning and student enrolment. Members of 2,016 committees were trained on roles and responsibilities. As part of the EU-supported Basic Education programme in Balochistan, 567 PTSMCs in low-performing schools were trained and engaged in developing and implementing School Development Plans, which include improving the school environment and replenishment of missing facilities including WASH.","2018-01-01","2022-12-31","Implementation","-","-","UNICEF","United Nations Children's Fund","European Commission, Government of Canada, Government of Japan, Government of Sweden, UNICEF Education Thematic Fund, United Nations Children's Fund","United Nations Children's Fund","-","-","Pakistan","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",,"8667109.02","9259182.02","6657541","","","","-","","","","-","1523571.15","1523571.15","1521098","-","1419278.87","1419278.87","","-","","","","-","1524259","1524259","1521098","Key messages on continuity of learning, safe school reopening and vaccination on UNICEF social media reached more than 15 million people, and 587,311 parents were reached with messages encouraging learning via SMS.

Learners in 388 girls’ schools and ALP centres benefitted from interventions targeting girls and 7,573 girls received MHM kits.  
Building on innovative strategies adopted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF continued to support targeted communication with SMCs, teachers, parents and other education stakeholders. SBCC is still a relatively new area for provincial governments themselves, and UNICEF’s specific actions were instrumental in reaching very large numbers of education stakeholders with key messages:  
UNICEF supported provincial government to develop and disseminate key messages related to COVID-19 prevention, continuity of learning and safe school reopening as schools started to partially open, and later on teacher vaccination. Key messages were disseminated using a variety of channels including mass media, social media, radio, WhatsApp and SMS. For safe school reopening guidelines, posters were developed and shared in communities and schools.  
Another specific action was continued investment in capacity building at the community level to make schools safe in the context of COVID-19 risks. SMCs were trained on safe school reopening and have continued to play a key role for wider dissemination of information in communities.

In 2021, UNICEF adopted an integrated and cross-sectoral approach to adolescent development and participation in order to advance adolescent programming and GenU Pakistan.  

 

A GenU Secretariat was established at NAVTTC through UNICEF support for two consultants for coordination and technical advice. The development of the GenU operating model advanced, with enhanced focus on adolescents and digital learning and skilling, partially supported by “Reimagine Education” resources. Partners including flagship government programmes, private sector, youth organisations and public sector were consulted on the value proposition and priorities for GenU Pakistan. Ideation labs across provinces for validation, synergies and to develop concrete initiatives will be held in 2022, followed by a launch.  

 

UNICEF brokered a partnership between Silatech (Qatar-based NGO focusing on job creation, entrepreneurship and participation of young people in economic development ), GenU Secretariat (NAVTTC), UNDP and Kamyab Jawan to improve access to jobs for young people above 18 years, by updating and improving the NAVTTC job portal in 2022 based on Silatech models. UNICEF is a member of the project taskforce.

Under the project, WFP provides unconditional cash assistance to adolescent girls enrolled in grades 6-10 in targeted secondary schools, along with sensitization to the communities for the importance of education and mitigating risks of girls dropping out from the schools. In 2021, WFP assisted approximately, 18,500 adolescent girls’ students in 242 government’ secondary schools with PKRs. 122 million in newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The cash stipends were meant to motivate parents to send and retain their girls in schools as well as to help them in buying face masks and other supplies required to join back to school.   

WFP has also supported the Education Department, with the provision of IT-related equipment (laptops, Hard drives, etc) and Personal Protection Equipment related to COVID-19 (Surgical Masks, soaps, handwash stations, etc) in 2021. Furthermore, on-job training for the implementation of a Cash-Based program, designing, and management of CBT set-up was provided to the mid-level managers of the education department. Take-home booklets comprising of nutritional and covid-19 sensitization messages were also disseminated among adolescent girls to improve awareness about pandemics, diet diversity, and personal health and hygiene. 

WFP conducted a project end evaluation and assessed the project's impact on girls’ education levels. An overall, 14% increase in enrolment was found which is the highest in the last five years while compared to enrolment trends on EMIS data. The previous highest was 9% which was noted during the 2019/20 session. The transition rate from middle to high (i.e., grade 8 to 9) improved to almost 100% in surveyed schools, and retention during the project life was also noted above 97%. The respondents shared that 74% of the cash stipends were spent on education-related expenditures, including transportation of girls to/from schools. 

WFP carried out activities in close collaboration with the Department of Education, KP at the provincial as well as at the district level. In addition, partnerships with UNICEF and UNFPA helped WFP avoid a parallel set of activities during COVID-19. At the federal level, WFP co-chairs the NEDPG with JICA for coordinated activities with education sector activities throughout the country. This year funding through GPE (Global Partnership for Education) and Education Cannot Wait initiatives were coordinated through NEDPG. After the signing of the global coalition on school meals by the Government of Pakistan, WFP is also engaged with other stakeholders in developing long-term partnerships for the improvement of overall education outcomes and for ensuring that every child is provided with a healthy and nutritious school meal.

The policy seeks to catalyze the widespread action on youth development on five priority areas viz. education; employment  entrepreneurship; youth leadership  development; health, fitness  sports; and social justice. A total of 11 consultations have been held, including consultations with specific groups like LGBTQA+ youth, young girls and women, youth in technical education and young persons with disabilities. About 1100 youth participated in these consultations across the state.A three day international conference on life skills for young people was organised in collaboration with Indian Association of Life Skills and Delhi University. Representatives from academic institutions, CSOs, research agencies and young people attended the conference. Deliberations were organised to highlight the importance of Life Skills in the post Covid Era where more than 500 participation was registered. Technical assistance was provided to lead a repositioning of the RKSK programme by UNFPA early this year. The key objective was to review progress done under the programme, innovations and best practices to be shared within states and chalking the way forward in advancing adolescent health and wellbeing across the country. As a result it is recognized to bring convergence between programmes and government departments to have focused investment in adolescents' health. Adolescence friendly knowledge products were developed by UNFPA catering to the emerging needs and aspirations of young people, such as development of resource package for Adolescent Health and Wellness Days, FAQ for Peer Educators and FAQ for Adolescent Health Counselors UNICEF CP- UNICEF played a key role in developing the Youth Policy in Karnataka and provided technical support in drafting policy guidelines and SoPs related to adolescent empowerment and child marriage prevention in Rajasthan and West Bengal. State Action Plans and programmes on AE and ECM have also been developed and initiated, with UNICEF's support, in states like Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, while partnerships with CSOs and youth platforms strengthened their capacity to engage with adolescents on CP and AE priorities.UNICEF YuWaah: YuWaah, together with UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP and UNV, has been supporting the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MoYAS) with systems strengthening and technical assistance at the national level across their flagship initiatives such as the National Youth Festival 2022, Yuva Samvad (dialogue with young people), the National Youth Volunteer Registry (NYVR) and more.
