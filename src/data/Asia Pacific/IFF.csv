Support will also be provided for the implementation of the provisions contained in the CMTA in close collaboration with key relevant government agencies. In the context of the Philippines’ overall trade facilitation performance and taking into consideration the ongoing reforms of cross-border formalities in the framework of the Single Window initiative, ITC will adapt its interventions to support the Philippines in priority trade facilitation areas, in consultation with the BOC and other relevant public and private stakeholders. 

All proposed interventions are fully in line with the development priorities of the Philippines, including the PEDP 2018-2022, which requests removing unnecessary regulatory impediments and enhancing trade facilitation for improving the overall climate for export development. They also correspond to two pillars of the Philippines Inclusive Industrial strategy i.e. Pillar 2, which aims to ease doing business and investment environment through strengthening institutional and regulatory framework and addressing bureaucratic practices and Pillar 4 focused on capacity building and Human Resource development programmes, to enhance skills of government officials in their area of their responsibilities.

Overall, the activities under this cluster will contribute to enhanced cross-border trade environment in the Philippines and, in the longer-term, they will be instrumental for strengthening the country’s position in international rankings and positive perception of its procedural and regulatory framework. This facilitated environment in turn will be essential for supporting economic growth and attracting investments to the country.

This work was accomplished and validated by the NHA. It has been published and is available at (Determinants of private sector engagement and empanelment under PMJAY : https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/375613). WHO has also supported evidence generation at the request of the Prime Minister s' Office (through NHA) on the preferred governance model for PMJAY. This investigated the use of the trust (mostly government operated health insurance) versus the insurance model (that involves contract private and at time public sector insurers and Third Party Administrators) to administer the scheme. The findings were used to inform the NHA on the choice of model to be employed. The study shows that neither model is superior.

Through pre-departure meetings, an extensive dialogue process was undertaken with youth and women’s rights groups, including with the Asia-Pacific gender equality advocates, to discuss strategies for effective civil society participation at CSW67. This also led to framing a set of inputs to the draft CSW67 Agreed Conclusions. The recommendations emerging from the pre-departure meetings were presented to MWCD, Government of India, at the Asia-Pacific Pre-CSW meeting held on 8- 9 February 2023 in Bangkok. At CSW67, civil society delegates of UN Women participated in key events, including CSW Youth Forum that saw engagement and leadership of six Indian Youth Advocates in a parallel event, namely #FeministFutures: Young Feminists Co-leading Policy Advocacy on Technology and Innovation (led by NGYAs from India); and 2 side events, namely Leveraging Public-Private Commitment for Women’s Greater Access to Technology and Education (organized by UN Women India, G20 EMPOWER and Permanent Mission of India); and Grassroots Leadership and Transformation: Charting the Path of Empowerment Through Technology and Skill Development (organized by UN Women India, Women 20 and the Permanent Mission of India). In June 2023, UN Women organised two interaction meetings with Ms. Lopa Banerjee, UN Women’s Civil Society Division Head. One of the two interactions were organised with the CSO partners and the other with the CSAG members only. The meeting focused on a discussion related to be debriefing on 67th session of the commission of status of women. the scope and challenges with respect to participation in intergovernmental processes and the GEF platforms were discussed. the group shared reflections on strategies for supporting un women’s partnership with civil society in India and globally. In addition, a discussion was organised on feminist foreign policy with the CSO partner on 6th June 2023. A robust and vibrant feminist movement holds key stakeholders accountable, pushes for more progressive policies, legislation, and access to services, and supports the realization of the human rights of women and girls. Hence, as part of GEF, a national platform for Feminist Movement Mapping has been set up. UN Women supported the formation of feminist labs that brought together 30 youth leaders from India to develop a community of practice for young feminist movement building and leadership. The knowledge products developed a repository of practical guides and tools on how to participate and contribute to feminist youth-led interventions. In its first phase, this programme has achieved the strengthening of an ecosystem of 100 youth leaders, built cross-linkages and advanced discourse towards feminist youth leadership building. In June 2023, UN Women and its Responsible Party, Gender at Work India, launched the following five knowledge resources on young feminist leadership building. The resources are based on an understanding of the youth leadership landscape, opportunities and challenges in India with a focus on marginalized identities and assertions. •	A literature review of feminist youth leadership programme •	A white paper entitled, Reimagining Youth Programmes: Seeking Support for Intersectional Feminist Youth Leadership for Collective Action •	A Needs Assessment Report for the Feminist Youth Leadership Programme •	A Practitioner’s Workbook on Principles and Processes of Feminist Youth Leadership Building•	A Resource Toolkit for Youth Leaders and Gender Advocates•	Film on Young Feminist Leadership ProgrammeWHO India Country office- 1. UN Country Team (UNCT) PRS Focal Points Meeting: In November 2023, WHO India in collaboration with the UNRCO convened a Prevention of and Response to Sexual Misconduct (PRS) focal points meeting wherein, officials from more than 10 agencies participated. WHO tools like the latest PRS Policy and Risk Assessment were discussed for collaboration. In the presence of Ms Susan Ferguson, Chair of the inter-agency PRS network, a set of ‘PRS-Mythbusters’ posters was also launched at the meeting. 2. Technical Expert Group Meeting on ‘Infertility Care in India’: WHO India in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) convened the first ever multi-stakeholder dialogue to strengthen ‘Infertility care in India’ in November 2023. The expert group included senior officials from Government of India, academia, public, private service providers and global experts. The meeting a) advocated for including infertility in the public health discourse in India with a gender, equity, and rights lens, b) set the stage for generation of prevalence data in India, c) started a dialogue on the proper implementation of the ART (Regulation) Act. 3.Inclusion of GER in programmes/trainings within WHO: WHO successfully included GER in a new training program called Field Epidemiology Training Program and Growing E-health Expertise Knowledge  Skills (GEEKS) for data personnel. The training is an in-service module of 12 months duration primarily for data personnel currently positioned at the national/regional level with National Polio Surveillance Network (NPSN), one of the largest teams at WHO India.","961890","714080","560925","UN Women: In the reporting year, UN Women, in partnership with Gender at Work India Trust and Point of Views, adopted innovative modalities for institutional engagement with women’s rights organizations and civil society organizations (CSOs), leveraging intersectional, inter-generational, and multi-stakeholder approaches to advance gender equality. Modalities and Platforms Beijing+30 Review Process Six virtual consultations were organized by UN Women, alongside Gender at Work India Trust and Point of Views, as part of the Beijing+30 Review Process. This initiative marked the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, aimed at advancing global gender equality. A Steering Committee of 14 experts was constituted in August 2024 to provide strategic guidance on achieving the goals set forth in the Beijing Declaration. Thematic Consultations Six thematic consultations were organized, focusing on Gender-Based Violence, Gender and Disability Rights, Power and Marginalization, Conflict, Peace and Security, Labour and Economy, and Gender and Climate Change. These consultations engaged over 454 participants, including diverse CSOs and grassroots organizations, to deliberate on critical challenges, strategies, and policy gaps aligned with the Beijing Declaration’s critical pillars. The outcomes of these discussions contributed to regional and global dialogues, with a focus on inclusive, intersectional advocacy. CEDAW Shadow Report Process UN Women initiated a confidential report on behalf of the UNCT, scheduled for submission in March 2025. This report will explore trends of pushback against CSOs and gender equality work in India. Additionally, the CEDAW reporting process integrates learning opportunities for grassroots organizations, ensuring that their voices are represented in policy-making processes.  ICO supported a youth leader who led a CSO delegation to the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on the Beijing+30 Review, amplifying the voice of queer youth to resist systemic oppression, reclaim erased histories, and transform the socio-cultural norms that marginalize LGBTQIAP+ communities. They demanded intersectional change and envisioned a future where every individual can live with dignity and pride.UNFPA: UNFPA, in collaboration with the CSO coalition Girls Count, organized two regional consultations (for East and West India) where 81 CSOs were oriented about preventing and responding to gender-biased sex selection.
