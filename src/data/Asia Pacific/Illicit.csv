Notably, all beneficiary States, except the Maldives, have ratified the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. This consultation is a stepping stone to assist the state in the ratification of this mechanism. This regional workshop convened government officials, archaeologists, museum experts, and customs and police officials from Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka to discuss the pressing issues surrounding theft and illegal trade of cultural artefacts.The workshop aimed to identify gaps in the implementation of national legislation and propose actionable recommendations for its enhancement. Key discussions centred on the looting of Sites and Monuments, addressing the challenges posed by digital platforms facilitating the trade of stolen artefacts and strengthening collaboration among South Asian nations to combat these crimes effectively.Representatives from participating countries shared their current legislative measures against the illicit trafficking of cultural properties. This exchange highlighted gaps and fostered a deeper understanding of diverse legal approaches, enhancing collaborative efforts for better implementation of the legislation.Participants learned about the broader implications of cultural property trafficking, including its links to organized crime, terrorism, corruption, and money laundering. They were also introduced to various resources such as the NatLaws Database—designed for judicial and law enforcement use—and UNESCO’s model certificates aimed at assisting member states in the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property.Through collaborative discussions held after every session, participants proposed several strategies to enhance law enforcement efforts. They emphasized the importance of maintaining thorough records of cultural properties, advocated for real-time data sharing across borders, and recognized the vital role that local communities play in the protection of cultural heritage.The following two officials from Maldives participated in the trainingMs. Zaha Ahmed, Director, Heritage Section  Acting Head of National Museum, National Centre for Cultural Heritage, Maldives Mr. Ahmed Nadeem, Chief Customs Officer, Maldives Customs Service.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
