The MSE sector is particularly vulnerable to the spread of disease due to cramped spaces and a lack of facilities that would otherwise help reduce the risk of exposure. To date, ILO has, in close coordination with the Ministry of Health, the Industrial Safety Division under the Ministry of Labour and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), worked to determine the OSH requirements for selected 1100 MSEs beneficieries in Gampaha and Kaluthara. The project is also engaging with local-level actors, including the district secretariat, the District Chamber, MOL, NIOSH, and MOH officers, to provide specific psycho-social support to MSEs in both districts. At the same time, the project is in the process of creating a multidimensional communication campaign to reach nationwide MSEs on both the physical and psycho-social aspects of return to work. 

Through the ILO-UNOPS MPTF project, it was required to identify the baseline information of 1100 beneficiaries as per the target indicated in the ProDoc. To identify these ground-level beneficiaries, ILO partnered with the Small Enterprise Development Division under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The officers of Small Enterprise Division, attached to the district and divisional secretariats, the were rigorously involved in mapping the data and selecting the beneficiaries. The ILO conducted two sessions in August for these officers on the data collection process. The questionnaire was developed in consultation with SED officers and then validated and converted to a digital questionnaire. The data collection was powered by the KoBoToolbox, developed by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, which is an open-source suite of tools for data collection and analysis in humanitarian emergencies. The data collected were finalized based on the recommendation on the selection of beneficiaries received by ILO ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The planetGOLD Mongolia project is working toward eliminating mercury in the ASGM sector by using a bottom-up approach, involving members of the ASGM sector directly in the creation and implementation of policies and practices to sustainably improve mining operations and livelihoods. In partnership with the national government, the project team is working to create an enabling environment for a formalized ASGM sector that enhances community development, improves productivity, and eliminates the use of mercury.
The project carried out number of interventions which contributed to the elimination of mercury in artisanal and small scale gold mining by applying a value chain approach from the miners to the refiners through reviewed and supported ASGM policy and legal environment; introduced Due Diligence Standard - OECD Due Diligence Guidance and CRAFT Code training to government officials and artisanal miners and developed training modules for government officials and artisanal miners. 
","1732439","1732439","1626774","Component 1The project continued to focus on capacity building, advocacy, and awareness raising activities for both policy makers and artisanal miners on the promotion of ASM formalization and better mining practices. In addition to formalization, due diligence, gola supply chain, estimation of mercury use and mercury impacts on health and environment were also covered in the training conducted at project target areas (Selenge, Khovd, Gobi-Altai Provinces). Training for government officials also included gender mainstreaming, gender sensitive policy planning and occupational safety and health in ASGM. The project also contributed and provided recommendations towards the revisions to ASM regulation, which was approved in August 2022.  Component 2The project organized trainings on knowledge and information related to planetGOLD criteria, traceability, the need for responsible ASGM and standards in order to improve access to finance and markets. The project adapted a business toolkit, developed by planetGOLD global, enabling the miners to record basic information of the partnership, the gold ore, income and costs of operation for potential investors. The project also successfully co-organized Mongolia's very first Precious Metal and Jewelry Forum and Expo with 60 representatives from BoM, MMHI, Ministry of Culture, MRPAM, FRB, PMAID, Customs Agency, Tax Agency, General Agency for Specialized Inspection, commercial banks, and Precious Metal Association. A total of more than 7,000 guests visited the Expo. To promote investment opportunities for the sector, the project continues to organize meetings and network with the financial sector. The Central Bank of Mongolia has agreed to conduct a combined discussion with the financial institutions in 2023 in order to provide information on the barriers faced by the ASGM sector in accessing financing.  Component 3 Preliminary work has been completed in 2022, including selection of sites, ore resource assessment, lab tests, and study of ASGM legal environment. Considerable progress was made within component 3, particularly the capacity building of ASGM stakeholders and MFPS installation.a. A series of capacity building activities took place to promote better mining practices in the project areas. In 2022, 438 people (63% male, 37% female) from the mining and local communities and government offices attended these training sessions on responsible mining, environmental practice, gender, and human rights, occupational safety and health, and business management. To sustain knowledge uptake as well as attitudinal and behavioral change, the project will conduct follow-up activities in the selected provinces. This includes follow-up training activities and experience-sharing events or study tours.b.  The project team has implemented a timely response to the national context, particularly in changing its strategy of building stand-alone MFPS in the province to supporting two existing plants in Selenge province, namely Shijir Khishig in Mandal and Tunkhel Manlai in Tunkhel. The COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Chinese border issue have significantly delayed the equipment importation from China and Colombia until Q3 2022. The equipment availability has enabled the commencement of the installation and calibration of the MFPSs. In addition, the project completed resource assessments of the project sites. The MoUs signedbetween the project and Selenge province governor and Mandal soum governor are expected to improve political support for the formalization of these processing plants.c. To better secure pollical endorsement, meetings and workshops with central policymakers were organized in June 2022 to discuss the current implementation of the Minamata Convention in the country and define challenges and solutions regarding mercury use reduction in the ASGM sector. In total, 58 officials (15 male, 43 female) from different government agencies participated. The key interventions suggested by the participants were to improve intersectoral coordination and information exchange, enhance the legal environment to support the formalization and professionalization ASGM sector, upgrade technology and equipment of processing plants, control mercury import, and conduct training and advocacy on the impacts of mercury use on human health and environment.d.  The project has made significant progress in mainstreaming gender aspects into the project activities, such as training sessions, training materials, technical assessments. Remarkably, a Gender Committee – a voluntary network consisting of gender focal points, miners, and local government officials nominated by the ASM NF and local ASM organizations – was officially launched in Mandal soum on September 15, 2022. The launch event was conducted in a hybrid format with 25 participants (18 women and 5 men). Following the launch, a workshop on planning and community-building participatory exercises was organized to help the members take leading roles and ownership of this body. The participants defined the vision, mission, principles, and values of the Committee and discussed and agreed on further activities for 2022 and 2023. Their vision is “to make artisanal mining socially recognized and gender equitable workplaces” while the mission is “to improve the quality of life by respecting people and empowering artisanal miners”. The Members proposed to conduct activities to strengthen the capacity of the Gender Committee and mining communities, improve collaboration among local ASGM stakeholders, advocate gender and human rights and contribute to ASM formalization in the project provinces. This piloted committee is hoped to address gender equality issues and to further the economic empowerment of female miners, who have traditionally missed out on the benefits from the booming mining sector.Component 4The project regularly provides updates and information to stakeholders and the public through its website and social media accounts. In 2022, more than 100 posts were shared and reach over 150,000 people. Over 8,000 copies of materials were distributed to national and local stakeholders on gender mapping report in the ASGM sector, legal framework analysis, ASGM trade, brochure on planetGOLD criteria for environmentall and socially responsible operations, and income and costs registration booklet for ASGM partnerships and cooperations. In order to advocate for ASGM formalization and create awareness of sectoral challenges, the project organized a journalists meeting which was attended by more than 10 journalists from national media outlets. The project also started sending bilingual (English and Mongolian) quarterly online newsletters informing project activities to stakeholders.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
