Women of mine action made evident development in their skills, improved their agency, and felt empowered within their families and communities. In the workplace, they demonstrated their capacity to the majority of male colleagues and supervisors. At a personal level, their self-perceptions portray life changing levels of socio-economic-personal empowerment for many of them, and career ambitions by most.
