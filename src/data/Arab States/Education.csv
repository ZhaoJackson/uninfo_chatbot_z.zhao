The Education & Learning pillar aims to improve the learning outcomes for children and market-relevant skills of adolescents and youth living in Lebanon. The Employment with Dignity pillar addresses the pressing labour market challenges in the Lebanese context that have been exacerbated over the past few years by multiple crises. The main aim of the programme within the employment pillar is to ensure enhanced economic opportunities and decent employment for vulnerable Lebanese host communities and Syrian refugees, with a focus on sectors such as agriculture and digital skills with potential for growth, job retention, and creation. The Protection & Inclusion pillar will increase protection and inclusion for refugees and host communities through strengthening of legal, policy and enabling environment for protection, social protection and inclusion. The ‘New Ways of Working’ outlines a framework to promote and document more effective and efficient programming, strategic learning, and support to policy development and implementation to transform the way partners and other stakeholders respond to the protracted stay of refugees in Lebanon and to the multiple crises e
Within the framework of PROSPECTS Lebanon, ILO’s focus has been on enhancing resilience of Lebanon’s crisis-hit labour market and creating better livelihoods for both Lebanese host communities and Syrian refugees.

The lack of access to modern and reliable energy services, resulted in a negative impact throughout all sectors in Lebanon. Energy provides services to meet many basic human needs, particularly heat, motive power, and light. Without adequate power, education facilities, amongst others, cannot properly provide any of their services. Most facilities are resorting to running diesel generators at excessive costs to ensure business continuity and this is further constraining their already scarce financial resources. Initiatives that thus assist the education sector in freeing income for backstopping services in a budget-constrained environment, such as the services of energy provision, will provide more resilience in the provision of education.
The objective of solarization of the targeted schools is to assist the Lebanese public education institutions to become more cost-effective, more comfort-related, environmentally responsible, and actively engaged in the transition towards a more sustainable energy future. The intervention will also reduce the cost of electricity paid by the school where savings can be used for other urgent needs in addition to ensuring a secure and sustainable source of electricity given the increasing electricity outage hours and high diesel prices after the subside removal. This project will also reduce the amount of fuel imported and burnt hence avoiding greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) emissions.""
