Experts and participants reviewed the experience of Bahrain and other selected countries in implementing the UN standards and norms applicable to the use of non-custodial measures, including for men, women and children, and discussed challenges, lessons learned and good practices. Approx. 120 criminal justice practitioners from countries in the GCC region as well as Jordan and Egypt attended the webinar. In September 2021, the Kingdom of Bahrain issued Decree-Law No. (24) of 2021 to expand the application of the provisions of Law No. (18) of 2017. 

• In February 2021, the Kingdom of Bahrain issued the Restorative Justice Law for Children and their Protection from Maltreatment (Law No. (4) of 2021). This was the result of a comprehensive national consultative and capacity-building process supported by UNODC to help align the draft legislation with applicable UN Standards and Norms and the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as other relevant human rights instruments. In October 2021, UNODC, together with the Judicial and Legal Studies Institute (JLSI) and the French and British Embassies conducted a regional webinar, under the patronage of H.E. the Attorney General of Bahrain. Law No. (4) of 2021 was introduced to the participants and in this context, experts and moderators facilitated discussions and experience sharing around the application of international standards, norms and good practices to fulfill the rights and needs of children in contact with the justice system. (To a certain extent this could also contribute to 39 below)

• For the first time in 2021, the activities implemented under the ongoing partnership between UNODC and the Ministry of Justice (2 webinars above-reported) also benefitted criminal justice practitioners from other GCC and MENA countries, and enabled Bahraini authorities to share experience relating to the development and implementation of new legislation on alternatives to imprisonment and child justice.","56170","56170","","In 2022, UNODC continued to strengthen national capacities to effectively prevent and combat trafficking in persons whilst upholding the rights of victims through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). 3 training workshops were conducted within the framework of the Regional Training Centre hosted by the LMRA, respectively on the topics of: (1) Concept of TiP: forms, indicators and mechanisms to deal with victims - attended by 40 participants (22 Jan); (2) Preparation of reports and evidence gathering at the TiP crime scene - attended by 40 participants incl. 33 from Bahrain (24-25 Jan); and (3) Strengthening coordination between the concerned authorities in cases of exploitation in the work environment - attended by 67 participants (6-8 Feb). Bahraini participants were from the Labour Market Regulatory Authority, the Ministry of Interior, the Attorney General's Office and the Supreme Judicial Council. Furthermore, the 3rd training workshop resulted in a major recommendation regarding the establishment of a task force team emanating from the NCCTP which was assigned to develop, with the support of UNODC, related standard operating procedures (SOPs) for better coordination within the NRM framework on TiP cases for forced labour. UNODC conducted jointly with the Ministry of Interior a new training-of-trainers session for officials who previously completed training programmes with UNODC, with the objective of increasing the pool of experts that may be engaged in capacity-building targeting law enforcement practitioners in Bahrain and other countries. The ToT session was delivered in 2 phases (27 Feb-3 Mar; 19-23 Jun) for 44 MoI officials. UNODC also participated in the national consultations hosted by the Royal Academy of Police to provide strategic advice on the development of a comprehensive capacity-building plan focusing on human rights in the administration of law enforcement and criminal justice. The consultations were attended by representatives of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Endowments, Attorney General’s Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NIHR, and civil society (29 Sep). Furthermore, UNODC participated in the official event to launch the 2nd cycle of the National Drug Control Strategy hosted by the Ministry of Interior, marking at the same time the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (June). UNODC participated in a meeting with members of the National AML Committee (May) and provided advice on an action plan to show enhanced effectiveness in the implementation of the national AML regime (in the context of the MENAFATF mutual evaluations); also facilitated practice sharing with another FIU from the region.

• In the framework of the ongoing strategic partnership between UNODC and the Labour Market Regulatory Authority to support the establishment of the Regional Centre of Excellence or Capacity-Building in the Field of Combating Trafficking in Persons, UNODC developed the training curriculum of the Regional Centre as well as the first module entitled “Standard Training Module on Manifestations of Labour-related Trafficking in the Gulf Region”. 

• In December 2021, UNODC together with the Labour Market Regulatory Authority jointly delivered a training workshop attended by approx. 40 labour inspectors of the LMRA's Preventive Inspection and Labour Inspection Directorates in the field of combating forced labour. The training marked the launch of the regional training programme that will be offered by the Regional Centre of Excellence for Capacity-Building in the Field of Combating Trafficking in Persons hosted by the LMRA in Bahrain, as part of the ongoing strategic partnership between UNODC and the LMRA. 
","14955","14955",""," In 2022, UNODC continued to help promote the experience of the LMRA/National Committee for Combating Trafficking in Persons and particularly the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) for victims of TiP - the first-ever NRM created in the region - as a good example (""model""). This included a study visit for 9 officials of the Moroccan Committee for Combating TiP to Manama to exchange experiences in the operationalization of the NRM (21-24 Mar). Moreover, the Chairman of the NCCTP met with UNODC Executive Director in March, where both parties reaffirmed their strong commitment to partnering on further promoting vicitim-centred approaches to preventing and combating TiP at regional and interregional levels. In addition, representatives of both the Saudi and Omani National Committees for Combating Human Trafficking (7 in total) participated in the training workshop on the ""Preparation of reports and evidence gathering at the TiP crime scene"" organized within the framework of the Regional Training Centre hosted by the LMRA, on 24-25 January. UNODC also continued to engage with the Attorney General's Office in promoting the use of non-custodial measures and sanctions in the region and beyond, by supporting discussions on the challenges, lessons learned and successes of Bahrain and other countries implementing alternatives to imprisonment, particularly in the context of a regional conference organized with Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in Morocco (28-30 Jun) and an international conference hosted by the National Institute for Human Rights in Bahrain (27-28 Sep).","450000","54500","","-","500000","10000","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
