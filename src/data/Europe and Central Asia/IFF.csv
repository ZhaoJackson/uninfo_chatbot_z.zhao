In 2021 a bill of law on adding articles on “digital violence” to Law No 6284, to Protect Family and Prevent Violence Against Women was submitted by Jale Nur Süllü, member of the EOC and an MP from Republican’s People Party. The MP had attended the violence against women in politics (VAWiP) workshop organized by UN Women and was inspired by examples shared.
Social activities held in Gaziantep and Izmir women-only centers and in online platforms brought women from host and refugee communities together to increase their social interaction and contributed to cross-cultural dialogue among them. Women acted in solidarity against common problems such as GBV and COVID-19 pandemic through solidary groups and women committees which also contributed to strengthening the social cohesion at the local level.

Out of them:•      Approximately 200 women have increased their confidence in financial matters, understanding economics and money management, financial goals and life planning, banking instruments, credit management, investments and many other topics during a comprehensive one-month-long training marathon “Bani la feminin’’, consisting of both online and offline components, complemented by individual and group study. This activity represented a transformative initiative focused on empowering women in their financial journey.•      A dedicated session was organized specifically to Ukrainian women refugees. The session attracted approximately 27 participants. The positive response and active participation in this specialized session underscore our commitment to inclusivity, recognizing and addressing the diverse financial needs of women in refugee circumstances.•      110 teenagers foster financial skills and independence by participating at financial education camps in Bălți and Comrat. The camps not only provided financial knowledge but also included visits to financial institutions, museums, and unique experiences like Crunchyroll, offering valuable insights into financial concepts. These endeavors extended beyond physical camps to an online financial education course tailored for parents (60 parents) who acquired necessary skills in discussing money matters with their children.•      200 teachers across the country learned about concepts related to financial literacy during a two-day training session and 21 kindergarten educators from four institutions have learnt how to teach financial literacy concepts to preschoolers effectively. Equipping teachers and educators with tools to convey the value of money and savings to young generation, these activities aim to foster financial responsibility from an early age.•    600 women and girls have continuous access to information related to finances and investments through a dedicated web page https://fb.watch/pochwICASg/, Facebook and Instagram profiles, a Facebook group and a Telegram channel for streamlined communication facilitated access.•      10 girls and boys from the Roma community in Hîncești district have gained information about the crucial role of women's economic empowerment and its contribution to the promotion of gender equality within families and communities. Participants have been engaged in discussions acknowledging the necessity of cultivating responsible behavior in managing personal budgets. 42 women refugees integrated in the labor market or any income-generating activity through the Cash for Work program (employment, internship, professional courses, registration of business, purchase of equipment, extension of business, social assistance and support of Moldovan entrepreneurs in recruitment of Ukrainian women refugees), offering them up to 10 000 MDL to enter the labor market. 35 women advanced in career while harmonizing their personal and professional lives through the voucher for children programme. The initiative encompassed enrollment of children at development centers, summer camps, day childcare institutions, and rehabilitation centers. Fifty refugee children (comprising 20 girls and 30 boys), aged between 3 to 15 years, have benefitted from this program, giving opportunities for their refugee mothers to use their time to explore labor market, to acquire new skills or to work while their kids attend various development centers.","51595","51595","51595","During 2024, UN Women focused on fostering career orientation in finance and entrepreneurship, starting from foundational education in schools and extending to advanced initiatives like networking and professional development for women in finance.Sixty-five schoolteachers from across Moldova enhanced their teaching techniques through two blended ""Teaching Methods and Techniques for My Finances"" training sessions. Conducted in collaboration with the Ok Foundation, these sessions emphasized promoting early professional orientation toward financial topics and boosting financial literacy for long-term independence.To ensure sustainability, a Curriculum for the Trainers of Trainers (ToT) was developed, training educators to deliver the ""My Finances"" module, part of the optional Economic and Entrepreneurial Education curriculum. Accompanying didactic materials, submitted for accreditation by the National Council for Curriculum, include tools, games, guides, and exercises designed to make financial education engaging and interactive for students.At a roundtable titled “Financial Education in Schools: Implementation Perspectives and Ensuring Sustainability,” 25 stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and experts, committed to integrating financial education as a core component of Moldova's educational system.115 women built their skills critical for success in the financial sector through the participation at the Women in Finance Club launch events, which combined personal storytelling through the ""People's Library"" concept and training sessions on topics such as public and corporate finance, conflict management, and financial leadership. A Guide for Women in Finance Ambassadors was also developed to support financial literacy training for youth, strengthening outreach and advocacy across Moldova.","24320","24320","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

With 43 pilot schools SEES is now present in all the regions, with additional attention paid to the regions with higher numbers of refugee children from Ukraine to strengthen protective environments. Focus group discussions among 121 adolescents representing 7 pilot schools have revealed that the majority of children know what is bullying, how to identify it, how to react and the importance of action from those who witness it. Focus groups served as a mid-term assessment on the model’s efficiency and perceptions by children and pedagogues. UNICEF developed a dedicated page on the U-Platform to consolidate key SEES resources informing children and teachers about pilot results, enhancing access to anti-bullying and mental health resources, and enabling children and pedagogues to share information and data on SEES activities.In 2023, a key SESS focus was on advancing participatory processes with adolescents co-creating anti-bullying solutions. UNICEF empowered 30 young people (20 female, 10 male) to practice their communications skills and spread the ideas of the SEES project in their schools, through peer-support groups, discussions with younger children on bullying prevention, art projects, and other initiatives. Applying the UPSHIFT methodology, sixty adolescents (52 girls and 8 boys), including five adolescents with disabilities, created social projects such as antibullying comics; a workbook for children and adolescents who use violence against their peers; and a board game “Smash bullying”.Advancement of SEES values and practices among parents and communities played a vital role in increasing the sustainability of peer-violence prevention interventions and promoted a violence-free environment not only in schools but throughout communities. Through a streamed online marathon, adolescents presented the results of their anti-bullying initiatives to peers, teachers, and parents from more than 30 schools across Belarus, reaching over 3,000 views and at least 6,000 peers, teachers and parents. Use of traditional and social media publications resulted in more than 32,000 views. As a result of the community engagement, 10 new schools joined SEES project and dozens more expressed interest.UNICEF also supported the Belarusian State Pedagogical University in piloting the psycho-social support programme, “Safe Spaces” in school settings. The model contains basic psycho-social responses to help children cope with stresses and was officially certified by the National Institute of Education. Starting from the 2023/2024 academic year, the model has been piloted in 20 Belarusian schools.","270000","140000","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
