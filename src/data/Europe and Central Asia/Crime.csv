Understanding the interrelationship between gender and security threats and crime is vital to the overall effectiveness of any response. Applying a gender perspective to UNODC’s work involves being aware of the gendered dimensions of any activity, which requires analysis, information and consultations with both women and men.

Regarding anti-corruption, UNODC carried out multiple initiatives and trainings at the request of and in consultation with the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and in collaboration with the UNODC Corruption and Economic Crime Section. From November 13 to 15, 2023 in Kyiv Ukraine, UNODC organized the workshop on ‘Financial Investigations for the Effective Detection of Corruption and Tracing of Proceeds of Crime’ which brought together 28 detectives and analysts from NABU. The aim was to strengthen Ukraine's financial investigation capabilities, an essential tool in the effective fight against corruption. UNODC bolstered the anti-corruption capacity and expertise of the Agency for Restoration (Recovery/Reconstruction) with two experts who are imbedded in the Agency by delivering training to NABU investigators on financial investigations and asset recovery in the anti-corruption context. UNODC also facilitated international cooperation for SAPO through the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Officers.

The themes addressed in the trainings and workshops included the development of e-learning content, integration and digitalization of border management systems, privacy and data protection aspects, and identification and prevention of trafficking in persons.  Furthermore, IOM strengthened the operational capacities of the General Inspectorate for Migration through the delivery of biometric identification devices, which will improve the processing of asylum claims and residence permits. IOM also commenced the implementation of the Digital Maturity Assessment of the migration IT systems in the Republic of Moldova, in partnership with the Estonian e-Governance Academy, for the benefit of the national migration authorities. IOM also supported the General Inspectorate for Migration (GIM) by presenting findings from the Migration Management Digital Maturity Assessment Report, developed in collaboration with the Estonian e-Governance Academy. This workshop outlined Moldova’s digital capabilities and needs in migration management, with further deliverables under review for final approval.  To support rights-based border crossing for Ukrainian refugees and TCNs, IOM initiated the translation of the Passport Examination Procedure Manual (PEPM), a key resource for improving travel document inspection and fraud detection while enhancing operational capacities at border control points. A consultant is also being recruited to deliver a training of trainers on data protection regulations, equipping officers with necessary skills to comply with the newly adopted legislation effective in January 2026. Additionally, IOM strengthened the Operational Coordination Centre of the General Inspectorate of Border Police (GIBP) by finalizing the TETRA radio stations GPS monitoring system, which enhances crisis response efficiency through real-time connectivity, improved communication, and optimized resource management. This upgraded infrastructure, including new radio channels and workstations for 19 mobile units, has significantly bolstered coordination, situational awareness, and timely interventions at the border.

The project aims to assist the Member States to more effectively investigate, arrest, prosecute, convict and disrupt terrorists, terrorist networks and organized crime groups. Throughout the course, participants are trained using localised scenarios reflecting the issues that would typically arise in that jurisdiction. Course materials also incorporate the domestic legislative framework used when prosecuting and seeking convictions of terrorists and terrorist networks. 10-12 prosecutors from the Prosecutor’s office for organized crime and corruption and judges from the Basic Criminal Court for Organized Crime and Corruption are participating in the Project. The AML/CFT Court Preparation project takes participants through their AML/CFT law and the elements of their AML/CFT offence with the overall aim of assisting judges and prosecutors to prepare sound case files linking the elements of the offence to the alleged conduct and evidence.

This knowledge enhances their ability to contribute effectively to counterterrorism efforts.In summary, the completion of the programme intervention resulted in a substantial augmentation of skills, a deepening of specialized knowledge, and an increased capacity to apply these skills in real-world scenarios for the participants from the Public Prosecutor’s Office for Organized Crime and Corruption and Basic Public Court. These acquired capabilities contribute significantly to their roles in combating organized crime and corruption, particularly in the realms of financial crimes and counterterrorism.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The project will be guided by the EU Gender Action Plan III and the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, formally initiated by the landmark UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), adopted on 31 October 2000. The WPS agenda affirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building initiatives. It rests on four pillars: prevention, participation, protection and relief and recovery. It focuses on the links between gender inequality and conflict, how they are mutually reinforcing, and emphasizes the need to understand gender inequality as a root cause and driver of conflict and fragility. The project will be in line with the pillar 3 of the EU Gender Action Plan III and specific measures of policy 3.5: Integrating the women, peace and security agenda: promoting and supporting inclusive policies/activities across the whole WPS agenda with full and equitable participation, also by men and boys; promoting the strengthening of the rule of law, the criminal justice system through transitional and restorative justice, and Security Sector Reform (SSR), to end impunity for perpetrators of SGBV crimes; promoting the provision of medical, psycho-social, legal and safety support to all victims/survivors of conflict-related sexual and/or gender-based violence/SGBV.  The project will follow the UNDP gender equality strategy 2022-2025 and the objective of achieving gender justice to realize rights. Hence, with UN Women and Gender Justice Platform, UNDP will provide continued technical, financial and policy support on link between gender equality and legal protection, gender responsive justice, security sector reforms, legal aid services, transitional justice and constitutional reforms. The main obstacles for achieving gender equality are deeply rooted in patriarchal norms, as well as in the lack of systemic solutions for persistent implementation of polices for achieving gender equality. These patriarchal patterns affect women deeply. It is fair to say that the legacies of the conflicts present huge obstacle in building just, equal societies, respectful of human rights and gender equality principles. Consequences of wars, conflict and economic decline affect women and men differently.    Women in the region have been specifically and deeply affected by these conflicts. Precise gender-disaggregated data on victims and survivors of the conflicts have not been part of information available from the prosecution offices or the courts, or reliable data on human losses and toll of war crimes victims, but a large part of the overall number of war crimes victims and survivors are women. They were most notably struck as the survivors of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) crimes.
