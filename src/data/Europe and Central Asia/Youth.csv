Over the course of five engaging days filled with workshops, meetings, and team-building activities, the participants delved into the complexities of human trafficking. Assisted by expert practitioners from international organisations and government agencies, the young people explored connections between trafficking in persons and broader issues such as migration, gender equality, sustainable development, and HIV/AIDS, gaining a holistic perspective on the phenomenon. The Summer School on Combatting Trafficking in Persons and Safe Migration agenda also equipped participants with practical skills in youth leadership through the session on Summit of the Future and youth impact on sustainable development; as well as social media engagement, particularly in creating impactful social video reels. By fostering these hands-on experiences, IOM aimed to empower young people to disseminate critical information on combatting human trafficking through various channels, especially digital platforms. IOM made efforts to utilize a creative approach and new technologies to bring up a new generation of students, migration advocates and counter-trafficking leaders. Following the educational sessions, the participants produced two social video reels to educate a broad audience about human trafficking and provide tools to prevent it.","14000","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

A proven strength of the project is the hands-on support to 33 employment offices with a wide geographical reach. The strategic coverage of the entire territory has resulted in 46% of the beneficiaries reached by the project being from rural areas- inherently known as areas with lower employment opportunities.
The internship scheme focused on young jobseekers and had a significant participation of women (256 out of 366).

In 2022, the GoU has introduced substantial measures to simplify access to disability determination procedure, and disability allowances. UNICEF jointly with UNFPA, UNDP, OHCHR, the GoU and OPDs launched the UN Joint Programme funded by the UNPRPD. UNICEF supported 60 Organizations of People with Disabilities (OPDs) to enhance their capacities on implementing the CRPD.  UN Joint SitAn identified lack of OPD participation in government policy making; weak organizational capacity of OPDs, lack of OPDs led by underrepresented groups, such as women with disabilities and no OPDs representing families of children with disabilities. As leading agency under UNJP, UNICEF supported the establishment of the Steering Committee led by the Chairperson of the state Inter-Agency Group on CRPD and Advisory Group of OPDs. For the first time grassroots OPDs and SIG were included in the policy making platforms. The Advisory Group of OPDs and members of Steering Committee include OPDs based on cross-disability approach and members of self-initiative parents’ groups (SIG).  Uzbekistan’s UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) is UNCT’s vision for one UN approach for CRPD implementation. UNICEF initiated the process as part of the recent findings from the UN Joint Situational (SitAn) Analysis on rights of people with disabilities. 25 UNCT members endorsed UNDIS under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator. UNDIS prioritizes the key pre-conditions for CRPD implementation in Uzbekistan in order to promote human rights-based approach to disability inclusion. At the same time, UNJP funded by UNPRPD and implemented jointly with the GoU and OPDs, provides coordinated approach in transforming social service delivery for women and children with disabilities.  UNDP supported the GoU efforts to incorporate international standards and best practices of disability inclusion. Together with governmental and nongovernmental partners, including OPDs it is providing technical assistance to nurture national expertise in disability assessment, social services, disability inclusive programming and budgeting. UNDP has capacitated the national partners and organizations of persons with disabilities (OPD) to provide more effective contributions towards disability inclusive policies, systems and the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in Uzbekistan, including on disability costing and budgeting in compliance with CRPD and the data collection, analysis and use to identify gaps and improve the budget allocation and usage, as well as on designing and building social services delivery for persons with disabilities. OPDs were systematically engaged in the national development strategy design through their involvement in the national development coordination mechanism and accountability frameworks.   To complement the SoP/MSR efforts a needs assessment on the availability, quality, accessibility and relevance of community-based services for GBV victims who are women and girls with disabilities was conducted on the example of Tashkent, Fergana and Samarkand regions of Uzbekistan. The study showed that further improvement of the legal and regulatory framework is required to protect the rights of people with disabilities, especially women and girls, as a special group at greater risk of violence and discrimination. A study also revealed that women and girls with disabilities experience isolation from society, which is a serious barrier to socialization and awareness.Training module on provision of inclusive services to GBV survivors was developed by the working group established from the representatives of NGOs, healthcare service provider, psychologists as well as members of the project Advisory group/organizations of people with disabilities. The training module and materials are based on the international experience, developed SOPs on MSR to GBV, governmental legislative documents, Central-Asian experience on the work with disabilities and international standards and provisions. 64 service-providers including the members of OPDs from Samarkand and Tashkent region were capacitated during pilot trainings conducted in coordination with the Senate Committee on gender equality and women as well as other national partners for Samarkand and Tashkent regions.","140187","140187","80000","UNICEF: UNICEF's coordination in implementing the UN Joint Programme funded by UNPRPD resulted in provision of age-appropriate services for children, youth and women with functional difficulties. The UNJP facilitated multi-stakeholder commitment to achieving CRPD-compliant SDGs, established a robust legislative and policy framework, and ensured accessible person-centred services. Notably, UNICEF strengthened the capacity of 50,000 patronage nurses on early identification and intervention and 500 teachers on Universal Design for Education. Two inclusive schools with accessible infrastructure were modelled, generating evidence to advocate for a more integrated approach for inclusive service provision. UNFPA:For the first time disability inclusion was integrated into SOPs on MSR based on the practical guide for service providers developed with the support of UNFPA and the Committee of Family and Women. To increase the availability of services to marginalized women and girls, and within the nationwide ‘implementation and scale-up of SoP on MSR to GBV’, 239 representatives of law enforcement, healthcare, social, and psychological services providers and OPDs were trained to better understand the needs and respond to GBV with a focus on women and girls with disabilities. This result was achieved within the interagency collaboration of UNFPA, UNICEF, OHCHR and UNDP as part of the Joint Programme. ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The main objective of the rapid study was to identify specific obstacles to the integration of ethnic repatriates (kandas) within the urban districts where they reside. The self-assessment, which is based on the Integration Self-Assessment Survey for Migrants and Refugees in Urban Settings, gives an opportunity to use migrants’ own observations and experiences of integration in the regions of destination to identify obstacles to economic, cultural, and educational integration and inclusion. This self-assessment tool, based on the grid of polling interview questions, was used to interview kandas residents in pilot regions by IOM national expert in coordination with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population and local executive bodies (akimats). The survey complements the results of the Assessment of South-North Relocation Programme by focusing on the institutional, infrastructure and economic barriers experienced by kandas. Based on the survey’s findings, a report is being developed  with recommendations to monitor impact of existing assistance and develop targeted interventions that can ease the identified barriers to integration for kandas.

The commitment to promote youth employment and reduce labour market detachment reflects the policy priorities that have been pursued by North Macedonia since 2018, when the Youth Guarantee – modelled on the European Union one - was piloted in the country and then rolled out nation-wide the following year. 20185 (10316 women) persons registered with the Youth Guarantee in 2022, out of which 7419 (3595 women) got employed within 4 months of registration. Rate of the successful exit from the YG (Percentage of participants who successfully completed the Youth Guarantee) in 2022 was 43%.ILO/ EU supported Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP)of North Macedonia for the period 2022-2026 builds on the lessons learnt since 2018 and the principles set forth in the Council Recommendation on A Bridge to Jobs – Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee (October 2020). Compared to the previous YG implementation plans, in the period 2022-2026 more emphasis will be placed on: (i) reaching out to detached young people where they mostly live, (ii) improving the quality of offers provided to young people registering in the YG service delivery system; (iii) establishing wider and better partnerships with other governmental and non-governmental actors, and (iv) building a stronger service delivery system.The YG delivery mechanism is expected to improve through: (i) the revision of organizational structure, staffing levels and funding envelope of the Employment Service Agency at the central, regional and local level; (ii) the expansion of preparation services (to include the validation non-formal and informal learning and outsourced employability courses) and subsidized offers of employment, continued education and training and traineeship; (iii) the strengthening of the Education Management of Information System (EMIS) and the increase of offer of adult education courses; (iv) the expansion of outreach activities and the progressive shift of tasks to municipal Youth Centres; and (v) data pooling mechanisms to allow the sharing of information across public institutions about young people (ESA, education, social security, tax authority, youth organizations, etc.).UNESCO: During 2022 UNESCO, as lead partner, together with the British Council and the Italian agency for Development Cooperation, launched the implementation of the EU-funded project Culture and Creativity for the Western Balkans, which includes North Macedonia among its beneficiaries. The project aims at promoting inclusive, fair and sustainable socio-economic development in WBs IPA Beneficiaries, and to improve reconciliation and good neighbourly relations in the region. Main thematic areas of intervention will be cultural heritage, intercultural dialogue, and creativity. The project will offer a systemic, effective and viable approach to enable progress across governance, policy and operational frameworks, by combining advice for policy improvement with data for informed decision-making, capacity-building, support to public-private partnerships, networking and funding opportunities for cultural and creative actors.﻿One of the core activities during the Regional Project’s inception phase was the launch of a comprehensive desk research aimed at mapping cultural and creative sectors in the Western Balkans IPA Beneficiaries, covering existing data and statistics, national and international legal frameworks as well as key strategic documents, cultural governance structures and relevant competences, main cultural heritage sites and elements, along with prominent cultural projects, events and activities. Collected information is being organised and presented in “Beneficiary files“.The members of the Advisory Committee were officially appointed and the Committee’s Terms of Reference approved, together with the updated Project’s Workplan, Logical Framework, Visual Identity, and Inception Report. UNDP:During 2022, through different UN initiatives and support services, 5,351 unemployed where activated in the labour market out of which 3,717 (69.5%) where young unemployed with 2.400 NEET. 339 young people received various trainings in future skills in key industries or got required skills as per employer’s needs. UN supported the Employment Service Agency in implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Through two youth umbrella NGOs (engaged over 60 young field workers) to support ESA’s Employment Centers in identifying and registering young NEET. With the support, over 5,000 young unemployed and over 1.140 private companies were informed about Youth Guarantee scheme in ESA. Out of 5,000 informed young, 2,400 NEET were registered in ESA’s data base (1,553 women; 6 persons with disabilities; and 193 Roma). With UN support, in 2022 total 404 jobs were created for young unemployed (282 full-time and 122 part-time).

Among the innovations introduced is the application by the Employment Service Agency (ESA) of a youth-specific statistical profile model for client segmentation. In North Macedonia, institutions and organizations involved in the implementation of the youth guarantee have relied significantly on the ILO's facilitation of peer-learning and triangular cooperation with other public employment services from the region and from the EU.UNESCO: See sub-output 1.1.4.1.","511498","146498","108498","UNDP:In 2024, the UN implemented targeted interventions to support youth employment, skills development, and labour market activation, with a particular focus on NEET youth. Through the Youth Guarantee initiative, 2,203 NEET youth benefitted from activation services, with 59% (1,299) being women. Dedicated youth coordinators played a key role in engaging young people, facilitating their transition into employment, education, or training.In parallel, tailored skills development programmes strengthened youth employability, equipping them with the necessary competencies to navigate the evolving labour market. A total of 2,300 unemployed individuals, including a significant number of young people, participated in business skills development and entrepreneurship training, leading to successful business creation and economic independence for many participants. Additionally, 385 individuals received specialized training to enhance their competitiveness in the job market.Employment outcomes for youth were further reinforced through active labour market measures (ALMMs), which contributed to the creation of 285 jobs for young people under 29 (159 full-time, 126 part-time). The integration of youth into the workforce was supported by youth (field) coordinators, who facilitated the activation of 505 NEET Roma youth, contributing to inclusive labour market participation.By leveraging targeted activation services, skills development programs, and inclusive employment measures, the UN continued to drive youth labour market participation, ensuring that young people, particularly those from vulnerable backgrounds, have access to meaningful economic opportunities.ILO:Phase II and Phase III of the EU-ILO Youth Guarantee Technical Assistance Facility continued to facilitate the labour market integration of unemployed and disengaged young women and men in N. Macedonia, in a systemic manner, through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. The ILO supported the enhancement of the framework conditions and institutional capacities requisite for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, through tailor-made technical guidance, recommendations, and capacity support. In this light, in 2024, the ILO focused on systematic support to the Employment Service Agency to enhance its functional organization; initiate a reform of the guiding legislation, which will enable modernization and digitalization of its services; reduce the deadweight through enhanced profiling of the unemployed persons and focusing the human and financial resources on the persons at greater risk of becoming long-term unemployed; improve the classification of employment services and ALMPs in line with the EU standards; adapt the ALMPs in the following years based on the cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the ILO facilitated 4 peer-learning events and exchanges of good practices among institutions involved in the design and implementation of the YG from the Western Balkans and EU Member States. It also facilitated the functioning of the regional Network of YG Coordinators, through organization of networking activities, aimed at strengthening institutional capacity via exchange of knowledge, information, and good practices.

Innovative schemes such as boot-camps, SDG hackathons that UNDP utilizes frequently to bring SuTP and Host community (HC) youth together can contribute to changing perceptions of young people at an early age when prejudices are easier to destroy. In this vein, in 2021 alone, UNDP brought together 1490 members of SuTP and HC youth in activities as diverse as ICT trainings, Hackathons, Mentorship, Social Cohesion and volunteering of which 645 are Syrians and 897 are women (both Turkish and Syrian) (EV ).
Additionally, in order to improve public sector capacities to promote social cohesion, UNDP trained 98 Youth Center Staff and Youth Volunteers of Ministry of Youth and Sports. The staff and volunteers organized Social Cohesion Festivals in Ankara, Bursa, Kocaeli, İstanbul and Şanlıurfa. 62% of the trained youth and youth center staff was women. Hardware improvements were made for computer classrooms in 30 Youth Centers in nine provinces (Ankara, Kayseri, Şanlıurfa, Hatay, Adana, Mersin, Kocaeli, Bursa and İstanbul) so that the Ministry is better able to reach Syrian and Turkish youth to improve their ICT skills. The project procured and delivered equipment worth a total of US $680.000 to establish state-of-the-art computer classrooms in 30 Youth Centers. A technology Hackathon was organized with the participation of  72 SuTPs and HCs in 5 provinces to give a chance to create tech-based solutions to social cohesion problems. Four solutions that were prized included an online platform for increasing access of Syrian and Turkish Youth to employment, a mobile application that will make it easier for Turkish and Syrian youth living in close neighbourhoods to get to know each other and organize sports events, a software that displays trainings and cartoons with VR technology to children and an online application where Syrian and Turkish youth can play games together and match with each other in e-sports activities.""

The training is part of programme on psychosocial support to people living with HIV and their families. During the training, young people were provided with basic knowledge on health and HIV, adherence to treatment and quality life with HIV. 
	Ensured participation of young person living with HIV in the World Youth Rights Conference on 12-13 August. Otabek Abdujalalov opened his HIV status for the first time and spoke publicly on behalf of a group of HIV positive young people, raising issues they face on daily basis. UNAIDS inputs were included into Declaration of the Conference. 
	In October - December 2021 UNAIDS organized workshop for 10 young people living with HIV on public speaking skills development. The main purpose was to train young people on public speech to draw attention to the problems of social inequality, stigma and discrimination against young representatives of key groups and PLHIV. As a result, participants of the training prepared and did their presentation on internal meeting. Final speeches will be presented on 26 February 2022.

","100000","36219","36219","Results and achievements:During July-August 2023, UNAIDS and UNICEF organized three training sessions for 76 adolescents and their parents from 9 regions in Uzbekistan. During the training participants were equipped with necessary knowledge on essential life skills for managing HIV, emphasizing the importance of HIV treatment, and fostering positive relationships with peers, parents, and healthcare professionals. The trainings were facilitated by four HIV+ young trainers, who are peer educators and UNAIDS volunteers. Two of them recently disclosed their HIV status, enabling them to share valuable information during the training and serve as role models for the participants. (Fergana 14,166 USD, Tashkent 22,053 USD)   On 26 October 2023, the Government of Uzbekistan initiated an international forum dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the topic: ""Youth rights: opportunities and protection mechanisms"". Gareth Jones, a UNAIDS consultant, highlighted diverse youth needs, UNAIDS' role in youth leadership, and challenges in HIV prevention. He praised Uzbekistan's Youth Parliament, emphasizing an enabling legal environment. The international consultant stressed the impact of punitive laws on key populations and shared insights from drafting the Agenda for Action for Adolescents. Gareth Jones urged leveraging the agenda for advocacy and making commitments to improve adolescent well-being.  Partnership: UNAIDS collaborated with UNICEF and NHRC to advocate for adolescent well-being and equip adolescents living with HIV and their parents with knowledge on essential life skills for managing HIV.  Lessons learnt:  The disclosure of HIV status by two young trainers serves as a powerful method for reducing stigma. By openly sharing their experiences, they become role models, challenging stereotypes, and contributing to a more supportive environment for individuals living with HIV.   Education, capacity building and awareness raising have become a powerful tool in empowering individuals to take control of their health and well-being. ","100000","10000","10000","In August, UNAIDS supported in launching the #UzYouthMentor Project, a transformative mentoring initiative for young UNAIDS volunteers in Uzbekistan, in collaboration with Chevening alumni. Over the six-month mentoring journey, mentors and mentees will meet to focus on empowering transformation of young people living with HIV. As described by one of the mentors, mentoring is a powerful educational approach that challenges, inspires, and empowers both mentees and mentors to create meaningful personal and professional growth.  In November, UNAIDS, in collaboration with the Republican AIDS Center, conducted an information session for World AIDS Day at the private Sehriyo school for students in grades 8-11. Around 140 students attended, gaining accurate insights into HIV transmission, debunking myths, and learning about the stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV. In December, to amplify the voices of young people living with HIV, UNAIDS organized a meeting between members of YPLHIV and the UN Resident Coordinator. Several YPLHIV members shared their personal experiences, highlighting challenges such as discrimination in healthcare settings, barriers to education, and mental health issues.  In December, UNAIDS led an information session on HIV for students at Westminster International University in Tashkent to provide students with essential knowledge about HIV, fostering awareness and understanding among the university community. About 30 students and staff members of the university were engaged in the event. Three young people living with HIV shared their experiences of life with HIV and challenges they face because of the misinformation. UNAIDS implemented a photo project featuring young people living with HIV, promoting creativity and self-expression. A photo story of Azima, a young woman living with HIV, was published on the UNAIDS global website: Azima’s Story. In September, UNAIDS organized a specialized photography walk, led by a professional photographer, aimed at enhancing the photography skills of young people living with HIV. The event provided participants with practical, hands-on experience in photography techniques, fostering creativity, self-expression, and confidence. Throughout the walk, participants learned about the technical aspects of photography, such as composition, lighting, and camera settings, while also exploring storytelling through images.

Here's a snapshot of the successes:Strategic Focus: By aligning with CEDAW and the Beijing Declaration, the program effectively addressed key priorities like tackling traditional gender norms, strengthening policies, and improving service access.Government Collaboration: Strong partnerships with the government and national partners led to concrete achievements, including the development of a CEDAW Road Map to improve legal protections for women and girls, signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for the scale up of essential GBV services, gaining support and commitment from key stakeholders to establish a lasting program of gender-focused volunteerism within sports schools and introduction of GBV related topics in the education of young soldiers in the army.Essential GBV Services: Collaboration with the National Red Crescent Society resulted in the launch of six Family Support Services in 5 regional capitals and Ashgabat city providing vital support to GBV survivors through hotlines, psychosocial counselling and case management Engaging Men and Boys: The program piloted successful initiatives to engage men and boys in championing gender equality and preventing GBV, addressing root causes and shifting harmful norms by introducing gender focused volunteerism programme in sports schools and capacity building of psychologists in military. Being a small-scale intervention, it helped create buy-in at the central and community levels for the gender equality concept among young men and boys, in particular. Partnerships with international counterparts: Collaboration with international organizations like the UK Embassy, OSCE, EU Delegation, UNODC, UNRCCA and UNDP amplified efforts through shared expertise, increased advocacy, and enhanced coordination.This focused approach, combining strategic alignment, strong partnerships, and targeted initiatives, has laid a solid foundation for continued progress towards gender equality and GBV prevention in Turkmenistan.Among lessons learned it's worth mentioning the below:Building trust with the national partners and showcasing the real results is a basis for the fruitful cooperation: men engagement piloting was monitored jointly with the national partners; launching of GBV services was undertaken as a joint decision with the national partners applying international and regional UNFPA expertise.Connecting Turkmenistan's development goals with UNFPA's expertise was a successful strategy in helping the country fulfill its international commitments related to gender equality, as outlined in the CEDAW agreement and the Beijing Platform for Action.Promoting gender equality and opening conversations on GBV prevention from bottom up, developing a bank of communication resources to showcase and promote gender equality in social media, engagement of young men and boys and working with stereotypes provoked lots of comments and responses making the online and offline conversations interesting and real. This approach proved to be working well and gathered many supporters for promoting GE and GBV prevention. More and more young men and boys exress their interest to join the men engagement initiative.","25000","25000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Additionally, the project ensures that security arrangements consider the different vulnerabilities of both girls and boys, particularly in emergency or high-risk situations.This project is in line with the UNICEF’ Country Programme Document which emphasizes on creating social change to address harmful practices affecting adolescents, such as child labor, child marriage, and other forms of violence, as well as to increase the parents' and communities' knowledge of protective behaviours and practices.

It also to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in Europe and Central Asia. The Alliance is to contribute to achieving the goals of the Decade of Demographic Resilience by offering a platform to receive support, and share experiences, in addressing challenges and harnessing opportunities related to demographic change in areas such as population ageing, migration, rural revitalization, empowering young people, gender equality, financing of social policies, and enabling people to have the number of children they want.

It shall be noted that the initiative for Demographic Education was suggested by the Academy of State Service and supported by UNFPA. Considering the fact that the national educational system does not offer the demographic education as a full-fledged program. Some universities offer this education in a fragmented manner under other disciplines in small sections. The SSC recognizes serious difficulties when it comes to analysis of population data and demographic forecasts. With the support of an international expert, a Concept Note for Demographic Education was drafted with information on global and regional education programs in demography and opportunities for partnerships, exchange programs for students and faculty members, overview of the Turkmenistan situation and how the initiative could be rolled over in the country. The Concept Note is being considered by the national partners for actualization in 2022 with specific and targeted actions.

Seed of Solidarity (Gracanica/e) - “Seed of Solidarity” one of the Best Innovative Ideas implemented in the municipality of Gracanica, aimed to plant the seeds of a better future.  This was done through workshops on human rights, peacebuilding and reconciliation as well as a visit to the archaeological park of Ulpiana as a symbol of the history that brings all Kosovo communities together.
Natural Peace (Gracanica/e and Vushtrri/Vucitrn) - The idea of “Natural Peace” was to create a workshop that would raise the awareness of young people from Albanian, Serbian and Roma communities, where they would be able to learn about important environmental issues and the importance of ecology for all of us. In this case, they would get to know each other, exchange experiences and work on a joint green project. The project was implemented in Gracanica and Vushtrri where youth also planted trees and installed trash bins as permanent evidence of cooperation between communities.
Stride for Peace - “Stride for peace” was one of the Best Innovative Ideas implemented in the municipality of Prishtina that aimed to inspire peace education to youth from different communities in Kosovo. The main idea was to educate youth in areas such as human rights, transitional justice, collective memory and to work together as a unity on the process of changing the narratives for the new generations.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The results were used for planning the activities of the youth center of Chernivtsi ""Youth Residence"", aimed at addressing the needs of young people and promote the realization of their potential in the existing context.","55000","17800","17773","Youth Well-Being Index (YWBI) 2024The Youth Well-Being Index (YWBI) project aimed to measure youth well-being at the municipal level and support evidence-based policymaking. Given the ongoing war, access to statistical data was severely limited, and youth displacement further complicated the process. As a result, only three partner municipalities—Dnipro, Kremenchuk, and Lviv—were able to participate in the latest YWBI survey cycle.In Dnipro, the survey was conducted between February and March 2024. Preliminary findings indicate:The highest indicator: Information and communication technologies (0.84, where 1 is the highest possible).The lowest indicator: Safety and security (0.42), highlighting a significant challenge for the municipality.These results emphasize the need for targeted interventions to enhance safety and security for young people in Dnipro. However, given the ongoing war, improving security conditions remains a complex issue requiring multi-sectoral coordination.In Lviv, the survey faced technical challenges on the platform and with partner businesses, preventing its successful implementation. As a result, no preliminary insights are available for Lviv at this stage.Youth Municipal Fund – LvivIn 2024, UNFPA supported the establishment of the Youth Municipal Fund as part of Lviv’s European Youth Capital initiatives. The Fund aims to strengthen municipal youth policy by mobilizing resources for youth-led initiatives and fostering sustainable engagement with key stakeholders, including:The Ministry of Youth and Sports of Ukraine,The All-Ukrainian Youth Fund,The Lviv City Council.The Fund’s membership includes five youth organizations working together to expand opportunities for young people in Lviv:Plast Lviv,Molodvizh.Center,Society Initiatives Institute,Lviv Open Lab,Foundation for Regional Initiatives (ФРІ).Key Achievements in 2024:Governance and Institutional FrameworkThe Fund successfully developed its charter and prepared the registration documents for the establishment of the Youth Public Union ""Youth Fund Lviv"".Outreach and VisibilityA brand book and website were created.A communication campaign was launched, reaching over 10,000 people.Partnerships and Resource Mobilization27 local businesses signed partnership agreements, ensuring sustainable financial support for youth programs.The Fund operates on a model where businesses allocate 10-50% of sales from jointly developed products to finance youth initiatives.Planned Interventions and Focus Areas:The Fund is designed to channel its resources into three key areas:Professional fulfillment of young people,Addressing the consequences of war,Promoting a culture of mental health care.The Fund aims to develop its interventions through a grant-based program, enabling young people to design and implement projects aligned with these priority areas. However, in 2024, no grant programs were launched, as the focus was on establishing the Fund’s legal and institutional framework.Importantly, the Fund integrates demographic resilience into its long-term strategy, ensuring that youth programming responds to war-driven demographic shifts. Future initiatives will target displaced youth, community cohesion, and sustainable youth-led development in conflict-affected areas.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Assessment, recommendations, and manuals were developed on how to advance PBB and RBM. UNICEF-UNDP joint work to support the Ministry of Economy and Finance proves that strategic planning capacities with sound results frameworks at various levels of public administration (national/strategic, regional, sectoral, institutional) are critical prerequisites for implementation of PBB in Uzbekistan.   UNICEF’s contribution in joint work under Global Flagship Finance Initiative was significant. At the initial stage UNICEF CO was swift to pitch to RO that national partners have been requesting continued support following successful accomplishment of UN Joint Programme to establish Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF). This was well supported by UNICEF ECARO through initiating discussions with and obtaining support of UNDP RO. Later, at the implementation stage UNICEF lead both programme implementation and administration of received funds.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the work was built on the extensive experience and comparative advantage of both UNICEF and UNDP: while UNICEF leveraged its strong expertise in development of key performance/programme outcome/output indicators for social sectors, as well as PF4C Global Framework to link them with the budgets, UNDP brought its extensive experience towards supporting the Government’s PFM reform agenda pertaining to SDG Financing (SDG budget tagging, SDG bonds, Tax for SDGs initiative etc.). UNICEF-UNDP joint work under Global Flagship Finance Initiative demonstrated One UN approach in action. It has complemented the work that both agencies have been conducting to support the government of Uzbekistan in establishing the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) and provided additional inputs for finalizing the SDG Financing Strategy. It also opened new opportunities for continued and closer partnership around ensuring coherence and coordination of conceptually interconnected reforms in strategic planning, budget management at all levels of public administration.

UNICEF also supported fifteen workshops to present the new model for functional assessment to service providers – including Centers for Social Work (CSW), schools and kindergartens – as well as parents in the three targeted regions.

UNICEF coordinated with line ministries and other relevant institutions the drafting of amendments to the Social Protection Law, Child Protection Law, Health Insurance Law, Healthcare Law and Primary Education Law in order to consolidate the provision of functional assessments for children and youth in line with the ICF. The amendments were approved by the Government and were put on the agenda of Parliament in December 2021. UNICEF also supported the revision of the draft Rulebook on ICF-based disability assessments, so that it is aligned with the three line-ministries – Health, Education and Science, and Labour and Social Policy – as well as other relevant institutions. 

While UNICEF has supported the establishment of functional assessment bodies which cover four of the eight regions of North Macedonia, children and youth outside the covered regions could not complete such an assessment and were thus not eligible to obtain access to educational and personal assistants. This resulted in difficulties in exercising their right to education, as well as problems in carrying out their everyday activities. To address this, UNICEF supported the creation of a special team to conduct ICF-based disability assessment to children from vulnerable communities in locations that are not covered by the regional assessment bodies.","72297","72297","71084","In 2022 UNICEF developed national capacities for expansion of the human-rights based model of disability and needs assessment of children and youth in in the North-East, East, Vardar and South-West planning regions. The initiated establishment of bodies for functional assessment in these regions will complete the introduction of the new model as a single-entry point for support services and benefits throughout the country. With UNICEF advocacy and support, the amendment to the Healthcare Law was adopted in Parliament, which ensured legal basis for the sustainability and the continued functioning of the functional assessment service, with a national and 10 regional functional assessment bodies for children and youth. UNICEF also supported the revision of the draft Rulebook on ICF-based disability assessments, so that it is aligned with the policies of the three line-ministries – Health, Education and Science, and Labour and Social Policy – as well as other relevant institutions.

The Concept embraced the general framework of the universal 21st century competencies developed within Belarus educational system, with a particular focus on social-emotional skills (SES). Based on the Concept, an Action Plan to build SES in Children and Young People for 2023-2026 was drafted. The Action Plan clearly defined the main interventions and implementing partners for each block and was submitted to the MOE for endorsement.International expertise was highly appreciated by the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the Republican Institute of Professional Education (RIPE) during development of the SES ME tool comprising 25 criteria and 94 indicators to measure 3 main SES components: emotional regulation, communication, and cooperation. The ME tool was co-created with adolescents from technical vocational colleges who provided recommendations and feedback. The tool will be piloted in 2024.To ensure the quality and sustainability of the SES integration in the education process the SES normative framework was supplemented by development of an in-service training programme for general secondary and technical vocational education teachers and methodological recommendations for different groups (e.g. teachers, administrations, parents) on how to integrate SES in the education process in schools and colleges.The in-service training programme for pedagogues was complemented with a curriculum for an elective courses on advancement of social-emotional skills among 3-4th and 6th-7th grade students and trainer guide developed by the NIE.

Since the support programme was launched in 2019, 19 LPAs out of 35 received comprehensive support from UNFPA, which is 54,28%. The programme will continue in 2024 and further reach out to at least 65% of LPAs. To support evidence-based planning in the youth sector, UNFPA conducted an annual analysis of rayon youth sector budgets showing the trend per each rayon (district compared to previous years and other districts). The network of Youth Centers was further supported in strengthening professional skills, programs and mobilizing young people at the local level. https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/nicoleta-reaboi-today-girls-our-country-have-opportunity-learn-express-their-opinions-and-lead In 2023, the Youth Centers Network expanded and counted 60 centers throughout the country. Only in the first semester of 2023, the Youth Centers reached over 28,000 young people (for the second-semester data is not yet available), including young refugees, young people from rural areas, young people with disabilities, etc. To align the youth work in Moldova to European standards UNFPA supports the National Youth Agency in developing a continuous training programme for youth workers, the activity will be completed in 2024. The annual Youth Workers Forum was co-supported by UNFPA. More than 200 young people and representatives of youth organizations advocated for youth role as agents of change during International Youth Day with UNFPA support https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/%E2%80%9Etrain-youth%E2%80%9D-gathered-young-people-all-over-country-ungheni-celebrate-international-youth-day 17 civic initiatives of young people from the country were supported methodologically and financially in 2023. More than 380 young people teamed up together with Youth Centers, teachers, and civil servants to transform for the better the localities in which they live. Gender stereotypes and discrimination, environmental crisis, lack of recreational spaces for youth, vocational orientation - these are just a few of the issues identified by young people across the country in the 'YouCreate' program. https://moldova.unfpa.org/en/news/young-people-solve-problems-local-level-17-initiatives-implemented-youth-their-communities","383500","383500","383500","UNFPA in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Research, the National Youth Agency, with funds from Swiss Development Cooperation and other key partners, achieved the following key results during 2024 to advance youth civic engagement and participation:In 2024, 8 districts from the country benefited from coaching and mentorship in development of result-oriented local youth action plans, local youth strategies, local youth programs. The support program for LPAs provided a detailed analysis of the situation of young people in the targeted districts and training for authorities, local youth organizations and young people active in the community in strategic planning of youth activities and participatory budgeting. It also provided individualized assistance for the development of a results-oriented action plan, adapted to local needs and tailored to the available resources for the next calendar year.  Since the Support Programe for LPAs was launched in 2019, 22 LPAs out of 35 received comprehensive support from UNFPA, which is more than 63% of LPAs.  To support evidence-based planning in the youth sector, UNFPA conducted an annual analysis of rayon youth sector budgets showing the trend per each rayon (district compared to previous years and other districts). The Report for 2024 is available here. UNFPA supported the Youth Centers Network in strengthening youth workers professional skills, programs and mobilizing young people at the local level. Thus, in 2024, the Youth Centers Network expanded and counted 67 centers throughout the country. Only in the first semester of 2024, the Youth Centers reached over 43754 young people (for the second-semester data is not yet available), including young refugees, young people from rural areas, young people with disabilities, etc.In order to align the youth work system from Moldova to European standards, UNFPA Moldova continuously supports the National Youth Agency in implementing the road map on youth work curriculum development. Thus, during 2024 were developed and approved the National Qualifications Framework for youth workers and the National Occupational Framework. The ongoing support for road map implementation is planned also for 2025.The annual Youth Workers Forum (2024 edition) was co-supported by UNFPA. More than 2600 young people with fewer opportunities, from rural remote areas, attended non formal educational and recreational activities, including outdoor activities within the Mobile Youth Center Program, supported by UNFPA.  UNFPA supports youth participation and civic engagement, with voting being one of the most impactful ways for young people to make their voices heard and contribute to the country's development. In 2024, UNFPA supported implementation of the youth mobilization campaign ""Drop Everything and Go Vote!”, organized by the Youth Centers Network with the National Youth Agency's guidance. This campaign was carried out with support from the United Nations Population Fund, Soros Foundation Moldova, and the Government of Switzerland. Thus, in recent national elections in the Republic of Moldova, youth voter turnout has increased. During the second round of the presidential elections on November 3, 2024, more than half of young people aged 18–25 (51.78%) and 26–35 (52.04%) cast their votes, maintaining the record turnout from the 2020 elections. The growing number of young voters results from sustained mobilization efforts and support through various opportunities and programs that encourage civic activism among youth. Young people are becoming more aware of their vote's power and ability to influence decision-making processes and actively participate in them.The potential to participate in change, think critically and use technology in a safe mode to the personal advantage were the key highlights of the series of public events organized in the frame of the International Youth Day, conducted with UNFPA support. The events were attended of more than 500 young people, representatives of youth organizations, LPAs and local youth led organizations. https://moldova.unfpa.org/ro/events/zit-2024-tinerii-pentru-spa%C8%9Bii-digitale-sigure-%C8%99i-incluzive ","319000","319000","","-","294000","294000","","-","","","","-"

During the reporting period 1,350 (1,053 women, 297 men) obtained knowledge and skills on how to use innovative tools to engage young men and women in community life, which is essential in view of the final stage of the decentralization reform. 
The First Youth TV Channel was established and functions as a unique communication platform for all youth workers throughout Ukraine, and already has 2,400 subscribers and 35K viewers on Facebook. 
Over 100 (60 duty bearers, 40 right holders) youth activists and public servants responsible for youth policy on subnational levels were engaged into online public discussion on the draft State Target Social Programme ‘Youth of Ukraine 2021-2025', organized by the UNDP on the request of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Some 283 participants (81 men, 202 women) gained experience in and basic knowledge of volunteering by implementing 11 local initiatives and 17 volunteer events. Additionally, 38 partner organizations joined volunteer activities. The participants of local events received the opportunity to get acquainted with the activities of local organizations and join them as volunteers that boosted the organizational capacity of local NGOs, which often have low visibility among local residents. According to the Ukrainian Volunteer Service estimations, around 30-35% of participants still keep in touch with the organizations they met at the Volunteer School and participate in further activities. 
Seven subnational youth civic initiatives were implemented in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kirovograd, Chernivtsi and Kherson oblasts, through which 831 young people (499 women, 332 men) were engaged in design and implementation of 21 civic education activities and 5 advocacy campaigns. The advocacy campaigns have resulted in adoption of 5 subnational youth policy documents which provide for establishing local youth councils, developing regulations on youth advisers in local administration, establishing competition of youth initiatives in the local administration, introducing volunteer management classes for university students and green waste management programmes at territorial community. 
According to the results of independent assessment of 44 youth-led initiatives supported by UNDP in 2017-2021, the initiatives contributed to the creation of community of people involved in the public and civic sectors who know how to engage young people.  Young people are now more inclined to believe that their ideas may come true. More than half of respondents, inspired by the experience, plan to continue their civic activity in follow-up initiatives. This implies an active search for new ideas and their implementation at the local level, or engagement as participants and volunteers (for more than a third of respondents). Still, one in ten participants engaged in youth civic initiatives is not motivated to participate in similar activities further.

The programme and the Lab itself were designed in a manner that is available and accessible to all groups, including marginalized groups of youth (i.e., from the rural areas). The Lab ultimately reached all VET schools that have courses in Chemistry and Technology and/or Agriculture and Veterinary, and directly worked with 626 students.UNICEF also created an innovation programme for university students in the hard/technical sciences. These new “Innovation Camps” aimed to foster social innovation from university students aged 18 to 22 years. The primary goal of these camps is to provide a venue for future researchers and scientists in the niche areas of environmental sustainability, climate change and biodiversity. Within 2023, two such camps were organized with 39 young people. The UPSHIFT implementation consistently ensured equal gender participation. However, anecdotal data suggested that girls were less likely to assume prominent roles in the teams. In 2023 the programme devoted specific focus on working with positive female role models to actively encourage young women and girls. This practice from UPSHIFT extended into the Innovation Camps and Biohacking Laboratory programmes and initial feedback is positive.","118000","118000","118000","Through the UPSHIFT and Innovation Camp programmes 245 young girls and boys from across the country led the development and implementation of social and technical innovations that addressed pressing issues in their communities.

The analysis of the situation and needs of rural youth was initiated, commencing with a stakeholder mapping exercise, with a focus on the existing policy framework and political participation of youth. Moreover, the Agrarian Olympiad for 2023 was conducted, becoming a key driver in talent recognition, environmental awareness, and the overall development and sustainability of the agricultural sector. Notable achievements include massive participation from 870 contestants and the identification of 39 diverse winners across categories. The winners were honored at the awards ceremony held on November 22, 2023, in Tbilisi, Georgia. The National Agricultural Olympiad 2023 received support and was conducted in collaboration with the USDA project: "" Safety and Quality Investment in Livestock’ in Georgia (SQIL), as well as private sector partners, including TBC for Business, Aldagi, Agrosphere, Baraka, Hektas, Georgian Wine Guild, Vinotel, Beko, Agromotors, Pomona and Muracha.

Within each of FAO’s 20 programme priority areas, youth has been included as a cross-cutting theme together with gender and inclusion. The Organization recognizes that youth are already at the frontline to build more sustainable agrifood systems and are best placed to rejuvenate the sector and acquire the knowledge and skills needed to innovate and uptake new technologies.Focus groups were held in 5 regions of Georgia to analyze the situation and needs of young people living in rural areas. The outcomes of the focus groups contributed to the elaboration of the Situation and Needs Analysis of Rural Youth. Youth workshops were held in Shida Kartli, Gori and in Guria, Ozurgeti. The draft of the Situation and Needs analysis report was presented at the youth workshop held in Tbilisi in April within the framework of the project, in which representatives of the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, as well as the Ministry of Environment protection and Agriculture and various stakeholders participated.On the basis of all three workshops conducted in Kartli, Gori and in Guria, Ozurgeti and Tbilisi , the Situation and Needs analysis report and the ToRs of the National Youth Network for Agrifood Systems and Rural Development were developed. The Core-group of the youth network of agriculture and rural development was formed, consisting of the representatives of the Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture and its agencies, and the stakeholders of various sectors. The 1St Workshop of the core-group was held, where the activities under ToR of the network were introduced.  ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Sanitary pad dispensers are installed in girls' restrooms, ensuring students in all 164 schools no longer need to leave class or seek pads from classmates or the school nurse.Within three months of installing the dispensers, the percentage of girls in the pilot schools who missed at least one class during their menstrual period dropped over fourfold, from 55.2% to 12.5%.Additionally, 56% of the girls surveyed said they feel safe at school. Nearly 39% of them also reported that boys no longer make jokes about menstruation and have become more respectful.School absenteeism during menstruation is a reality in our country, as confirmed by teachers and social workers. Due to low family incomes, many girls are forced to skip classes or use alternative products such as cotton, gauze, tissues, socks, bedsheets, or even sleeves from their younger siblings' clothing.In an online survey involving 558 female students, many respondents reported experiencing irregular and heavy menstrual cycles, hormonal imbalances, and, in the absence of enough sanitary pads, having to leave school early in the day. Moreover, menstruation now often begins much earlier (at 8–9 years old), making access to pads a necessity rather than a luxury.In the new school year, alongside equipping schools with dispensers and sanitary pads, nearly 700 teaching and non-teaching staff participated in online training sessions. These sessions focused on puberty development, menstrual health and hygiene, and effective communication about sensitive and ""taboo"" topics.

Within the framework of the project, the Skills Agency elaborated (and will be enhanced in the upcoming months) the Capacity Building Programme encompassing general modules, VET authorization standard specific modules and respective guidelines to help public schools prepare for the authorization processes granting them a right to implement short term training-retraining VET programmes. These will ensure inclusion of NEET youth and other vulnerable groups into the learning process On the national level, the project ensures accessibility of VET system by NEETs and other vulnerable groups conducted by the Skills Agency. The following key results were achieved in partnership with the Skills Agency: ·      the Skills Agency developed career management service, the same as orientation service for persons with disabilities. Based on the regulatory framework of the inclusive education, the orientation service provides opportunities to persons with disabilities to use the service throughout the year and prepare for the desired professions. ·      the Skills Agency began to develop sectoral network of VET teachers in the ares of personal services and health care. The sectoral network is percieved as one of the key mechanisms for supporting teachers in VET, through enhancing development of VET teachers, professional advancement, sharing of sectoral news and cooperation between VET teachers. ·      To strengthen VET institutions through introducing entreperenurial VET college model, the Skills Agency trained relevant personnel and identified the organizational structure. ·      The concepts for introducing digital and blended learning in the helath and wellness sectors of Georgia, as well as distance and home-based work opportunities are elaborated including elaborating the new qualifications, occupational and educational standards as per requirement of new regulatory framework, which in addition to „competency mapping“ and validation process implies increased private sector engagement. ·      the Skills Agency elaborated the Capacity Building Programme encompassing general modules, VET authorization standard specific modules and respective guidelines to help public schools prepare for the authorization processes granting them a right to implement short term training-retraining VET programmes.In total 1516 VET students and schoolchildren, 16 college staff members, 34 HUB college staff members, 41 HUB college partners, 92 college and school staff members and partners from local governments benefitted from availability of needs-based institutional development plans put in practice for provision of diversified VET services.   ","500000","500000","492244","  UNDP’s achievements in this direction include the following:  &gt;Establishing strong foundations for institutional development and introducing vocational training into general education. The project accomplished this by elaborating comprehensive guidelines and developing relevant capacity-development programmes for public schools, thus enabling them to obtain authorization for vocational programme implementation.  &gt;Introducing extracurricular activities through clubs and institutionalizing relevant student services led by Sunny House (Project Partner). These achievements contributed to enriching educational outcomes and developing competencies that are in high demand in the labour market (something that has proven difficult to achieve exclusively through formal education). The project also transformed student life, making it more engaging, accessible, motivating and productive. UNDP (CBLLL project) supported the development of new programmes and educational opportunities in the target sectors by establishing platforms, networks and capacity-building opportunities. (CBLLL supports the organizational development of sectoral skills organizations by creating new sectoral networks comprised of college-level academic and private-sector representatives).  UNDP CBLLL project has transformed two partner VET colleges into entrepreneurial organizations, thus creating unique spaces for learning and development in the region. The project focused on NEET (not engaged in employment, education or training) youth and empowered VET providers by introducing ‘catch-up’ courses as a second-chance opportunity. Two such catch-up courses on digital and financial literacy have been developed and are slated to be piloted in partner schools. Other planned activities in this area include capacity-building for school administrators and teachers.  The project elaborated and strengthened services for supporting the key competency development of youth, NEETs and persons with disabilities, thus making vocational education accessible, relevant and inclusive for lifelong learning. In vocational education, accessibility, inclusiveness and relevancy of services are immensely important on multiple individual and societal levels. Although vocational education is focused on educating for the labour market, the social impacts of creating fair and equal opportunities by engaging vulnerable populations in productive activities for individual and the common good should not be overlooked.  To that end, CBLLL activities create new models and modalities to ensure that vocational education is relevant to the needs of both human and labour market development and that it offers innovative services, including digital and blended learning. The project developed a concept note on introducing digital and blended learning in Georgia to be used as a guiding document for digitizing resources and processes in VET systems.  Educational resources, modules and videos created in entrepreneurial learning enhance entrepreneurship competencies in formal and informal education programmes that are available in VET institutions. The elaboration of career education and orientation services for persons with disabilities was introduced in partnership with the Skills Agency. These services, available through vocational education institutions, are essential instruments for advancing opportunities and skills for better employment.  Following UNDP’s long-standing experience and approach, the project’s elaborated and piloted models are institutionalized for replication and nationwide scale-up in other sectors.

The volunteers of YK have strengthened their capacity to develop and deliver information through social media by applying posters, videos, etc. To enrich the learning outcomes of young people, UNFPA developed and equipped all 41 YKs with innovative learning materials about sexual and reproductive health and rights, including a board game and online quiz ""Without Taboo"", puzzles and posters with changes in puberty of boys and girls, board games on HIV/AIDS prevention and use of modern contraception. In addition, 5 podcasts/video formats were developed and will be widely disseminated to young people, parents, teachers in 2022.  

This year the peer education program through social media has been extended to the Russian-speaking community. As result, volunteers conducted an information campaign on 1- Reproductive health; 2- The phenomenon of violence against young people (at home, at school, in the community, between young people); 3 - Cyber Bullying and 4- Mental Health / COVID-19 pandemic conditions (Anxiety, depression, laziness, distrust, isolation, loneliness, lack of motivation). They have reached out to 113646 adolescents and youth up to 24 years through social media and to another  12794 boys and girls through offline peer education activities. 

In addition, to strengthen the capacity of the Youth Klinics network to align their programs and services to the needs of young people from vulnerable groups, in partnership with NGO ""Health for Youth"" and Coordination Center of YK ""Neovita"", the international ”Out of School Comprehensive Sexuality Education Guidance” was translated into Romanian and presented to key SCOs working with young people.

The report draws from extensive literature reviews, focus group discussions with 77 adolescents and youth, and key informant interviews with national partners and UN agencies.While Turkmenistan has shown a commitment to youth development through national policies and international agendas, gaps remain in data collection and implementation. The report indicates that youth are eager to participate in society, but that opportunities and access to information are limited. The existing legal framework promotes youth participation, but there is a lack of established mechanisms and youth-led platforms.Key areas of concern include health and social protection, education and employment, gender equality, and marginalized youth. While progress has been made in certain areas, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights, challenges persist due to cultural barriers, limited access to information, and gendered social norms. The report emphasizes the need for increased investment in mental health support, recreational opportunities, social protection, and climate resilience for young people.The education system, while inclusive, requires improvements in teacher training and modernization of vocational education. The transition to work life remains challenging, with high rates of youth unemployment and a need for better career guidance and employment support services. Gender inequality continues to affect young women's access to education, employment, and social participation.The report concludes with recommendations for the UN and national partners to strengthen data collection, promote youth participation, and address gaps in services and opportunities for adolescents and youth in Turkmenistan.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In total, 2327 VET students have been reached by peer educators since September 2020 when the Network was established.  

To ensure the quality of peer education activities, peer educators have passed a complex training program, which also included an offline summer camp. They have learned about healthy nutrition, prevention of bullying and GBV, sexuality, and changes in puberty, HIV and STIs prevention, prevention of teenage pregnancy, etc. Due to the extended COVID-19 period and restrictions for offline events, to ensure meaningful and equitable engagement of peer educators they have been equipped with tablets and the internet. 
The Network of Peer Educators teamed up with Pupils Council in VET and jointly organized an informational Campaign on preventing HIV/AIDS starting with December 1st. Moreover, 311 parents of VET students have been taught by psychologists and specialists on adolescents' development how to support their children in a safe transition to adulthood. 

The main UNFPA implementing partner in building the Network is Foundation Terr des Homme Moldova, with core funds from the Austrian Development Agency and co-financing from UNFPA. ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

It also provided information about the enrollment procedures and offered legal support related to enrollment. However, the schools are struggling with capacities, and those schools with the highest number of refugee children cannot provide sustainable and adequate support to children. Teachers also lack the capacity and skills to work with refugee children, which needs to be tackled in the upcoming period.The overall school enrollment rate among Ukrainian refugees has increased in comparison to the previous year, but it still stands low at 20-25% of children from Ukraine attending Montenegrin schools.

More than 2,200 media reports mentioning UNICEF were generated in 2023. Child poverty, violence, health and education were published on the front pages of dailies more than 40 times and these articles mentioned UNICEF. The number of UNICEF Montenegro social media followers (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and YouTube) increased by 4 per cent from 121,384 to 126,013. In 2023, the UNICEF Montenegro website gained 214,000 new users. One of the key highlights of UNICEF public advocacy and comms was related to the parliamentary elections. Within the two weeks before the national parliamentary elections, media releases with calls to action to all political actors were published by UNICEF and NGOs with the aim of focusing the pre-election public debate on the best ways for Montenegro’s new government to decrease child poverty and all forms of violence, as well as to improve access to and the quality of education and health for every child. Also, a youth political campaign was led by an inclusive group of UNICEF Montenegro Young Reporters. It culminated in a live two-hour dialogue two days before the elections, with representatives of all political lists answering questions from young people from all over the country about what they would do to resolve issues in education, violence against children, youth mental health, climate crisis and child poverty. Meetings with the president, prime minister, ministers, mayors and other decision makers were used as opportunities for communicating publicly key priorities and asks for children. Safer Internet Day, International Education Day, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, World Children’s Day, World Parents’ Day, World Poverty Day, World Breastfeeding Week, World Immunization Week, World AIDS Day, International Volunteers’ Day, Human Rights Day and others were marked. As a result, nationally representative research from 2023 shows that there is significant public support for prioritizing child rights issues. Eighty-nine per cent of citizens support inclusive education. Seventy-six per cent support fostering and adoption instead of placing children without parental care in an institution. Sixty-three per cent think corporal punishment is unacceptable. Nine out of ten think the government should have a reduction in violence and child poverty, and improvement of the quality of education and health care for every child and family as its priorities in the coming period.

In 2023 UNFPA will continue implementing the out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) program. This initiative will follow UNFPA’s International Technical and Programmatic Guidance on Out-of-School CSE and will focus on reaching adolescents and young people in rural areas, those with disabilities, and youth from the left bank of the Nistru River.
In 2024, the initiative aims to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment where all young people, regardless of their background, have access to comprehensive sexuality education and essential resources for a healthy and informed future. To achieve this, several institutions and organizations working with youth will be equipped with dedicated spaces for non-formal sexuality education activities.
Additionally, civil society organizations, particularly those in underserved regions, will receive support to enhance their capacity in promoting young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. Specialists from various organizations will be trained to deliver accurate, age-appropriate education on these topics, ensuring that young people are well-informed and empowered.
Furthermore, parents and caregivers of adolescents with disabilities will be provided with the necessary knowledge and resources to support their children’s development and smooth transition into adulthood.
In 2025, UNFPA will continue strengthening civil society organizations and youth networks across Moldova, including those on the left bank of the Nistru River, to develop and implement programs on sexual and reproductive health and rights tailored to diverse youth groups. To support these efforts, UNFPA will create guidelines for delivering youth-friendly health services for vulnerable youth, aligned with international out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (OOS CSE) standards.
A digital training program will be introduced for facilitators working in CSE, ensuring they are well-equipped to provide accurate and effective education. Additionally, new educational and interactive materials, such as the Diary of an Adolescent Boy/Girl, will be developed to make information on sexual and reproductive health and rights more accessible and relevant to young people. 
Building on UNFPA Moldova’s expertise in youth well-being and global best practices, and in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) and the Youth National Agency, UNFPA will establish the Future-Ready Hub—a pioneering space dedicated to life skills development, innovation, and modern technologies.
