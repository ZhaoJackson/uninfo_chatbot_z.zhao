The endorsement of the gender strategy in education has been hindered for over a decade due to political speculations and anti-LGBTQI discourse elevated by religious institutions. With the policy drift boosted by Ukraine’s EU candidacy and Biarritz Partnership framework, the gender equality agenda has gained momentum and finally received sufficient support from policymakers backed by UNFPA's technical expertise and continuous advocacy efforts. Being approved in December 2022 the Strategy is aimed at ensuring implementation of equal rights and opportunities for women and men, as well as prevention of and counteraction to any discrimination in the educational process at all levels through introducing changes in structural and organizational aspects.In addition to it, the UNFPA-capacitated technical expertise and advocacy resulted in adoption of methodological recommendations (сriteria) for carrying out a gender-sensitive anti-discrimination examination of textbooks. These criteria were approved by the Institute of Education Content Modernization on November 30, 2022 and set a basis for shaping a culture of inclusiveness and non-discrimination within the education system at all levels.  In 2022 to boost institutional capacities of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine on gender mainstreaming UNFPA facilitated the set up of the working group on equal rights and opportunities for women and men in education and accomplished the gender audit of the Ministry. The gender audit revealed areas for improvement and provided recommendations in terms of ensuring equal rights and opportunities in career promotion, decision making, establishing unified regulatory framework and staff training to address existing gender stereotypes.  From the capacity building perspective UNFPA created and trained a pool of trainers among education professionals in the methodology of social-emotional learning to ensure a sustainable effect of promoting anti-discrimination approach in education. SEEL (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) is an educational program developed by specialists at Emory University, USA, teaches methods of coping with stress and emotion management, and helps students succeed in school, in their careers and life. The scale up of the methodology planned for the next year will mitigate the mental health problems of Ukrainian school children triggered by the war and favour the culture of inclusiveness in school communities.

Thirty newly trained schools adopted the SEEL programme through tailored implementation plans, bringing the total number of UNFPA-supported schools to 105. In December, the MoES approved the report on the five-year SEEL pilot phase, recognising the successful testing of the methodology. The decree recommended the programme implementation in secondary education institutions as part of the New Ukrainian School model and instructed regional education departments to integrate the SEEL programme into the learning process.

In October 2023, three women successfully concluded the TVET program at Kazakh-British Technical University. This strategic initiative ensures that the project stays aligned with its outlined objectives and targets.At the same time, it is crucial to highlight that the evolving geopolitical situation in Afghanistan significantly influences the project implementation from various perspectives. The ongoing escalation of restrictive policies in the country directly affects an essential objective of the initiative, which is the post-educational employment of Afghan women. While the majority of programme graduates have decided to pursue further education and advance their careers abroad, a small number of women who return to their home country attempt to enter the labor market. The UNDP project teams in Kazakhstan and Afghanistan consistently monitor the project graduates, staying informed about their occupations and future plans.","103303","103303","102499","-","19200","19200","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Furthermore, in November 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a policy for a pilot project designed to strengthen the security of the educational environment in schools operating under martial law (Resolution No. 1245, dated 1 November 2024). This policy incorporates UNESCO's technical recommendations for optimizing security measures in schools. In addition, 19 specialists in the area of Safe Education Environment and 110 crisis response master trainers have been trained to equip educators with the skills needed to create safe and secure environments. Cascading training sessions have already begun in the Zhytomyr and Odesa regions. As a result, 7,400 teachers, administrators, and other staff, as well as 350 members of cross-sectoral teams, are now equipped to manage emergencies and ensure the safety of approximately 38,000 children in schools. Also, UNESCO supported 20 Inclusive Resource Centres with additional diagnostic tools (SAFA and MPR) and 40 specialists were licensed to use them. These diagnostic tools will help them diagnose a variety of developmental disorders in young children and youth, as well as war-related trauma, including learning disabilities. The 20 IRCs can provide diagnostic services to at least 140,000 children. ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Additionally, UNHCR will continue advocating for higher education opportunities for refugees, including exploring the potential rollout of the DAFI scholarship program in Moldova. Through these interventions, UNHCR aims to foster sustainable inclusion, ensuring that education serves as a pathway to protection, resilience, and future self-reliance for all refugee children, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds.

The joint SSC and development partners' consultations had also helped to move forward on the issues related to the inclusion of migration and disability questions in the Census questionnaire.

In the absence of formal demographic education in Turkmenistan, the SSC recognizes serious difficulties when it comes to analysis of population data and demographic forecasts. With the support of an international expert from the Institute of Demography of High School of Economics of Russian Federation, a set of training materials for Demographic Education for masters, bachelors and civil servants was developed and tested evoking a great interest on the Academy’s side to mainstream and promote Demographic Education in the educational system of Turkmenistan.

A series of seminars on demographic projections and mainstreaming population data into planning and monitoring were arranged for the mid-level decision-makers and technical specialists of the Ministries of Health, Education, Social Protection, Economy and Finance, and the State Statistics Committee in November 2023. A week-long course Population and Development was provided for the students of the Academy of State Services under the President of Turkmenistan. This educational facility is the only one that trains mid-level decision makers who normally in future are selected for higher level GOV positions. Therefore, this investment has a strategic nature as the future decision-makers better understand the population data and its use for socio-economic policies and planning. A lecture for university students was also arranged to evoke interest in mainstreaming demographic education into the bachelor’s programs. All these efforts were highly important as the country has no devoted education programs in Demography. Therefore, this type of intervention helps to keep the national capacity in the use of population data and demographic projections at the appropriate level. Moreover, they lay down a base for more focused and devoted curricula at BA and MS levels, that are being discussed at national level attracting more support and understanding the importance of the population data for development planning and formulating population policies, as well as better understanding the demographic resilience options.   ﻿A staff member of the State Statistics Committee was enrolled in the MS in Demography programme offeerd by Prague University.

UNFPA supported the publication of the 2022 Census, which made it possible to publish the data in December 2024. Aiming at increasing the understanding of national stakeholders, a series of workshops were conducted in all regions, disseminating the main results of the Census to local government bodies and public organizations, empowering them to utilize the data for informed decision-making. Furthermore, a Turkmen delegation participated in a workshop in Geneva focused on Population and Housing Censuses, facilitating the exchange of international best practices. Demonstrating a commitment to long-term capacity building, UNFPA supported the education of a staff member of the State Statistics Committee in the MS Programme on Demography at Charles University of Prague.A study tour was conducted for a Turkmen delegation, focusing on international best practices in Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data collection and processing, providing an understanding of the best practices on population data management system, including familiarization with the statistical system for collecting and processing administrative data on civil registration and vital statistics, studying the processes of conducting a population census utilizing population registers, and examining the role of civil registry offices in their interactions with the public. This initiative aimed at contributing to the improvement of CRVS data quality and its integration with census data.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Individual implementation plans have been developed for each school to equip educators and students with resilience and soft skills to prevent GBV. The institutionalization of the SEEL methodology has been strengthened through the signing of the joint Memorandum of Understanding for the Development of Social and Emotional Skills in Children and Youth in Ukraine between the Ministry of Education and Science and other national partners. 2. Over 2023, UNFPA has significantly contributed to the implementation of the Objective 2 of the Strategy for Gender Equality in Education, specifically to its task #35 covering professional self-determination and mastering of professional skills in accordance with personal abilities and interests without limiting them to the framework of ""female/male"" and motivating girls and women to choose non-stereotypical STEM careers.This was achieved through  STEM projects “Science Ambassadors”, “OL Science Festival”, and “Ecolab” in cooperation  with Lviv Open Lab and partnerships with local authorities, academia, youth spaces and civic partners.The “Science Ambassadors” project promoted gender-sensitive science popularisation among educators and helped them master digital teaching tools. It also assisted teachers in presenting themselves and their research effectively, especially for 390 high schoolers from vulnerable backgrounds. The project included a storytelling evening, ""Frankly about Science"", four videos highlighting women's contribution to science and gender-sensitive teaching, a methodological guidebook titled ""How to talk about science and yourself in it"", and a social media campaign covering 48000 people.The OL Science Festival featured innovative science shows and hands-on activities covering various fields. As a result, 4322 participants, including young people and families with children from Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Lviv, advanced their knowledge about gender stereotypes in science and were empowered with STEM opportunities in profession choice. On average, 36% of male participants improved their understanding of gender stereotypes, while 52% of girls acknowledged opportunities in science-related professions. ""Ecolab""  project intensive equipped 42 vulnerable young people  with green skills and knowledge to create an environmentally friendly, sustainable future.3. UNFPA has expanded its cooperation with the Ukrainian Education Hubs, a national network of lifelong learning programs focused on developing Ukraine's human capital implemented in collaboration with the Association of Innovation and Digital Education under the aegis of the Ministry of Education and Science. Apart from the support of Ternopil and Volyn Hubs UNFPA has developed and piloted a SCORM course, ""Career Alarm is Over!"" which incorporates storytelling, gamification, and interactive tests, and is available on the platform of the Ukrainian Education Hubs (https://bit.ly/scorm_course)- So far, more than 2,000 young people have completed the course, expanding their knowledge and opportunities to choose professions without being constrained by stereotypes.- Over 2,500 young people engaged in 48 training sessions focused on career guidance and STEM. Additionally, 1,075 high schoolers underwent career guidance tests, receiving personalized lists of sectors and professions aligned with their abilities.

In addition to in-service training, efforts will be invested to enhance the quality-of-pre-service teacher education, which implies better connections of theoretical learning with practice and shifting university education from a teacher-centered to a child-centered approach. Professional development initiatives will also address potential teachers’ biases towards inclusion and gender and build their self-efficacy to support and promote inclusion. 
To increase demand, UNICEF will work intensively to increase community engagement by gaining a better understanding of communities’ knowledge and attitudes towards ECEC, promotion of the importance of ECEC among parents and caregivers, and to address prejudices towards the inclusion of vulnerable groups of children in mainstream ECEC (e.g. children with disabilities, Roma, children without parental care). The parents, families and communities will be involved in design and implementation of those interventions. UNICEF will work on advocacy and professional development initiatives towards building stronger parent/caregiver-preschool partnership, taking into consideration engagement of fathers and men in ECEC. 
UNICEF will also support the establishment of referral mechanisms which can foster quality inclusion of Roma boys and girls in ECEC, by engaging different local sectors and Roma authorities. It will support ECEC systems to introduce and improve inclusive ECEC education for children with disabilities, by supporting governments in establishing integrated early intervention and detection services and mechanisms as part of ECEC (with endorsement of the ICF and in collaboration with health and social protection sectors), by fostering teacher collaboration which brings services to their natural environments (rather than segregated services) and the usage of community referrals outside preschool institutions themselves. UNICEF will promote the social and human rights-based approaches to inclusion in BiH communities, in close cooperation with key advocates- Roma leaders and DPOs (Disabled Person’s Organizations).

Gender equality is fundamental for democratic and social cohesion processes; therefore, it is strongly mainstreamed into all segments of the project. Since many gender roles and stereotypes are formed in early adolescence, the project will work with educational authorities as well as directly with young people to tackle gender-based stereotypes and bias, as well as any other types of discrimination. Building on the experiences from previous phases, the project will continue strong gender equality promotion including through a gender informed approach as well as integration of gender concerns in the project activities (such as capacity buildings, selection of beneficiaries, small grant facilities awarding, etc.). Such approach will strengthen capacities of men and women youth leaders and intellectuals to become the next generation of leaders who believe in equality while working together towards common goals. Moreover, this will result in the establishment of gender-responsive dialogue and stronger joint problem-solving culture between different groups and mechanisms for peacebuilding. Nonetheless, through the Small Grant Facility (SGF), a strong gender component is envisaged also including support to women’s CSOs contributing to gender equality and women’s empowerment, while taking into account gender-specific issues relating directly to peacebuilding processes.","2 - Significant contribution to realization of human rights","-","Collaborative activities related to culture and education stakeholders will ensure cross-sectoral cooperation and promote common topics of arts education, cultural heritage, human rights, and peace education.","1 - Contributes to sustaining peace empowerment in a limited way","","-","Lejla Hrelja",,"910000","910000","140000","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","510000","510000","140000","-","400000","400000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

A significant upward was recorded for children from the most vulnerable groups - the number of children with disabilities and Roma children attending kindergartens increased by 7% and as much as 47%, respectively. With the support of the EU and in partnership with Rain Barrel Communications, 42 professionals from 21 preschools participated in the SB4C related training which focused on improving communication skills of preschool professionals for changing attitudes and practices, as well as for engagement with communities and parents. Following the training, community-based action plans were implemented in 19 municipalities, contributing to such significant increase in enrolment. To improve access to preschool for children living in rural areas, a needs analysis was conducted and four new outreach services were established. Currently, 29 outreach preschool services are active throughout the country.Broj djece upisane u predškolsko obrazovanje povećan je za 7% u odnosu na 2021. godinu, te stopa obuhvata trenutno iznosi 75.99% za djecu uzrasta 3 - 6 godina (75.23% za djevojčice i 76.72% za dječake). Značajan porast obuhvata registrovan je i kada su u pitanju djeca iz osjetljivih grupa: broj djece sa smetnjama u razvoju u vrtićima porastao je za 7%, a broj romske djece za čak 47% u odnosu na prethodnu godinu.Uz podršku EU i u saradnji sa Rain Barrel Communications, 42 profesionalaca iz svih predškolskih ustanova u Crnoj Gori (21) učestvovalo je u obuci usmjerenoj na unapređivanje vještina komunikacije sa roditeljima o važnosti predškolskog obrazovanja, te mijenjanju stavova i praksi, kao i vještina za saradnju sa lokalnim zajednicama i roditeljima i starateljima. Nakon obuke, vrtići su sproveli akcione planove u 19 opština, što je doprinijelo povećanom upisu djece u predškolsko obrazovanje. U cilju unapređenja pristupačnosti predškolskog obrazovanja djeci koja žive u ruralnim oblastima, sprovedena je analiza potreba i uspostavljene su interaktivne službe/vrtićke grupe u ruralnim oblastima u četiri opštine. U Crnoj Gori trenutno funkcioniše 29 vrtićkih grupa u udaljenim ruralnim krajevima.  To make sure that teachers and parents support their children through digital and innovative approaches, a variety of digital content was developed and published on the national Digital School Platform continued in 2022. The platform now includes 200 interactive games for children up to 6 years of age, as well as 150 courses with 900 lessons for preschool professionals and parents 36% of all preschool teachers use the platform in their every day work.","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

In response to this call, UNFPA provided a targeted assistance to the Office of Deputy Prime Minister of European and Euro Atlantic Integration, Ministry of Education (MoES), Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoES), Institute of Education Content Modernization, State Service of Education Quality, Ukrainian Institute for Education Development, as well as to regional departments of education and regional professional development centers for educators in the following areas: (1) building an anti-discrimination expertise of the education content creators and experts, (2) support of young women and girls in a stereotypes-free career choices, specifically in STEM professions, (3) promotion of a zero tolerance to violence.
- To ensure a sustainable and catalytic effect of promoting antidiscrimination approach in education, throughout 2021, in cooperation with NGO EdCamp, UNFPA conducted 28 comprehensive online trainings for 1734 state educational content experts and representatives of the government agencies Institute of Education Content Modernization, State Service of Quality Education, and Ukrainian Institute of Education Development on non-discriminatory and inclusive approaches in education. At a more functional level, UNFPA developed an institutional partnership with the largest textbooks publishing house of Ukraine “Ranok”, certified 43 textbook authors and experts after completion of a training program on creation of a discrimination free content, ​​and issued a guide for educators on non-discriminatory teaching. In line with regular trainings, UNFPA also started the development of a complex online course “Education without Discrimination” which would soon provide a robust multidimensional instruction to educators on a harmful impact of stereotypes and means of creating a safe, diverse, and tolerant education environment.
- To embark a broader teachers’ community on a dialogue about stereotype free education, UNFPA supported the organization of several massive international experience exchange and networking events, particularly a 25-day virtual professional development study tour to Sweden “EdMandry” for 1237 educators which got familiarized  with the specifics of Swedish education system, including the principles of a lifelong learning, project management and non-discriminatory approaches in teaching, and a multi-day National EdCamp Joy conference for 1161 educators which included 18 expert sessions from renowned researchers and community leaders and was dedicated to the tolerance and counteraction of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers’ and students’ mental health. As a result of these activities, more than 4000 educators improved their competence in applying an anti-discrimination approach in education and acquired theoretical and practical skills of eliminating stereotypes from the education process.
- Responding to existing inequality, UNFPA enforced its support to the national network “STEM girls” which promotes STEM professions among girls and young women all over Ukraine. During 2021 UNFPA ensured that more than 10 000 girls had a chance to practice STEM and improve their chances to get profession in tech or IT sphere through organization of the national virtual celebration of the Day of Girls in ICT and the National Day of Girls in technology, supporting STEM Camp, the Hackathon “Hack4Good” for high school female students and STEM challenges. STEM chapters coordinators received two 5-modules training courses on soft and communication skills to promote STEM chapters in their regions and three quarterly meet-ups, involving 118 coordinators. As a result of such an active engagement strategy, in 2021 STEM girls’ network grew almost three times, increasing the number of its chapters from 31 to 118. The number of active members in the STEM Girls Community also increased from 1,263 girls to 1,513 girls.
- In 2021, UNFPA held its 4th in a row annual contest “Best gender sensitive STEM lesson” which aims to promote gender sensitivity of STEM lessons through integrated approach and innovative methods. 5 best lessons were acknowledged and recommended for application by the Institution of Education Content Modernization. 
- From a public awareness perspective, UNFPA promoted stereotype free career choice through engagement of high-level advocates and popular opinion leaders. In frames of the celebration of the International Women’s Day, the First Lady of Ukraine joined the UNFPA inspirational video about 5 Ukrainian girls who challenged the idea of stereotypical career choice and succeeded. The video reached over 119 000 views in social media and got 61 publications in the media. For youth and teens from the East of Ukraine, UNFPA provided an online training on stereotype free career choice through partnership with NGO Vostok SOS.
- UNFPA sustained its long-term support of WikiMedia WikiGap marathon engaging 101 authors who produced 723 Wikipedia articles about outstanding female Ukrainians jointly with NDI and Swedish Embassy. Moreover, under the WE ACT Programme, UNFPA supported the She did it Wikipedia editing marathon by creating special nominations to focus editors’ attention on improving 250 articles about Ukrainian sportswomen and female diplomats.

Ten healthcare posts in rural communities were provided with equipment for rapid diagnostic, so that more than 2,000 women in the targeted rural communities got access to medical diagnostics. Moreover, the improved access to healthcare has enabled local residents to utilize treatment and diagnostic opportunities significant to their health and wellbeing. The total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries of these initiatives is 84,839 persons (51,3% women). Lastly, an informative and user-friendly website of the Kherson Children's Hospital was developed and launched in close consultation with the hospital to provide potential patients with better and up to date information. UNDP also helped to address challenges in the education sector. The support included provision of basic equipment (tablets, wi-fi routers) and access to Internet, enabling children from 97 low-income families (in total 441 persons, including 52,6% women) to access online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The information materials on vaccination were broadly disseminated through digital media channels, reaching an audience of 79,958 people, including 36,473 residents of Kherson oblast. Also, as a part of the campaign, two webinars (“Vaccination of children with disabilities” and ""Vaccination for communities: COVID-19 and other infections”) were conducted in March 2021 enabling 410 people to receive verified information and and comprehensive answers to common questions about vaccination.

","38713","38713","38713","UNICEF: The results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of 2022 highlighted concerning setbacks in student learning outcomes in reading, mathematics, and science in the country. This learning crisis is further exacerbated by low preschool enrolment. While there was 6% increase in enrolment of children 3-6 years old, the current rate of 44% still falls considerably short compared to EU targets of 96%. To address this challenge, UNICEF actively advocated with municipalities to transform free school spaces into pre-school facilities as part of the optimization of school’s network initiative. Moreover, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and 21 municipalities to improve school readiness and early childhood development outcomes of Roma children, aged 3 to 6,by deploying Roma mediators in each of the municipalities to engage with parents of Roma children and facilitate early childhood enrolment and attendance. UNICEF engaged in extensive advocacy efforts that contributed to the submission of amendments to the Law on Primary Education, aiming to ensure that children in educational correctional facilities have access to certified primary education. This provision is intended to empower them to continue their education and acquire the qualifications necessary for future employment. While the amendment has successfully passed the first hearing in Parliament, it is currently awaiting final adoption. Additionally, on the children's takeover of Parliament, organised on the occasion of World Children's Day, allowed a highly visible opportunity for children and youth to express their concerns about the lack of access to and quality of education and to advocate for the fast adoption of the amendments to the necessary laws. UNICEF further emphasized these demands through letters sent to the Minister of Education and Science and Members of the Parliament. The Ministry of Education and Science's absence of feedback on the 2022 Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) strategy stalled the Bureau for Development of Education's (BDE) initial plan to introduce scaling up of CSE as a stand-alone subject in the 9th grade, impeding its implementation.UNFPA continued to work with and to support the BDE in other complementary processes - including participation of a national delegation at the regional CSE workshop in Sarajevo in August 2023, where different approaches and modalities were presented by countries that have advanced with CSE implementation. The lessons learned from the workshop, and the country context were further discussed, and  UNFPA supported the BDE in defining the modalities to integrate CSE topics into existing school curricula, as part of the ongoing periodic review and update process of the school curricula for various related subjects. Furthermore, UNFPA supported the BDE with mapping of relevant stakeholders and experts to assist the BDE in reviewing school curricula and incorporation of CSE topics. As the first step in the process, UNFPA will support the BDE in Q1 2024 with the reviewing of 7th and 8th grade school curricula for Biology (primary school),  where CSE contents would be integrated,  appropriate and in line with the UN International technical guidance on sexuality education. The need for access to information related to the sexual and reproductive health of the young people is clearly stated in the new National Youth Strategy 2023-2027, providing the grounds for intervention in the school curricula.","41456","41456","41456","As part of the analysis of the European Child Guarantee, data was collected across various areas, including education, to assess access to education for children experiencing poverty and/or social exclusion. This assessment focused on specific groups such as children with disabilities, children living on the streets, and those in conflict with the law. A validation meeting with relevant stakeholders was held in June 2024.To support evidence-based policymaking in inclusive education, UNICEF held consultations with over 60 representatives from various stakeholder groups. Feedback from these consultations informed the development of a policy document, which was used to advocate for ensuring that the proposed amendments in the Law on Primary Education uphold and advance inclusive education without any regression.UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education and Science in preparing for the transfer of preschool education responsibilities from the Ministry of Social Policy, Demography, and Youth.

In the course of 2022, UNFPA and UNICEF contributed to the development of the National Strategy on CSE (finalized in July 2022). This document is a prerequisite for scaling up CSE at national level, following the CSE piloting in 2021/2022, at 3 primary schools. The strategy was designed in a way to offer innovative approaches and solutions to CSE in the educational system. The strategy focuses on 2 main priorities: Improving the knowledge, skills and attitudes of students in the area of comprehensive sexual education and Increasing awareness of the need to study the contents of comprehensive sexual education in primary education. To facilitate collaboration among the Balkan countries Cluster, with support of the EECA Regional office, the UNFPA CO organized a sub-regional CSE workshop, entitled ""Championing young people’s health: a journey towards the wellbeing of the 8 billion"". The workshop created a platform for partnerships between the institutions working on CSE in the Western Balkans to strengthen CSE advocacy and implementation in the Western Balkan countries by sharing good practices and examples of modalities of CSE implementation by the main key actors and stakeholders from North Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, as part of the SRH portfolio and cooperation with the Macedonian Association of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, out-of-school CSE sessions have been delivered to high school students at several high schools across the country.UNICEFUNICEF continued supporting the implementation of the new Concept for Primary Education and curricula through capacity-development trainings for teachers. The transformation of the former special schools into Resource Centres that support the inclusion of all children in mainstream education was supported through capacity-development for staff and the development of various training programmes - a Programme for Professional Development of Education Assistants, a Training Programme on Alternative and Augmentative Communication and a Training Programme for Teachers Working with Refugee, Migrant and Asylum Seeking Children (the latter was drafted in 2022, but will be piloted and finalized in early 2023).In the lead-up to the Transforming Education Summit organized by the UN Secretary General, a series of 10 national consultations on the future of education were organized by UNICEF and the RCO, with over 600 youth, students, teachers, municipal officials, parliamentarians and CSOs. Based on the input from the consultations, a national statement of commitment was prepared and presented at the Summit in New York by the Prime Minister. Support for strengthening of the counseling and support role of pre-schools continued through mentorship and reflective consultations with the 20 parenting practitioners from preschools, who delivered parenting group sessions that aim to promote positive parent-child relationships and create supportive and nurturing environments for children. In 2022, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, UNICEF continued supporting schools facing WASH and IPC challenges. UNICEF continued collaboration with the tripartite WASH committee, of representatives from the MoES, Institute for Public Health and the State Education Inspectorate. As a result, 58 predominantly rural satellite schools received mobile handwashing stations – effectively covering 8260 students. Additionally, technical staff representatives from these schools received specialized WASH training and helped advance the hygiene improvement plans of the schools. Finally, a thorough communication strategy was developed to tie IPC and WASH resources with school behaviors and practices conducive to safe environments","54860","54860","54860","UNHCR - No substantial results in 2022. UNHCR was invited on meetings to providing advice and technical assistance in producing policies, documents for the education to become inclusive of refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons. Recognizing the importance of increasing learning outcomes, UNICEF advocated for and invested in the ongoing curricula reform. As part of this effort, the new curricula for grade six and seven was developed and UNICEF supported their alignment with the Primary Education Concept and with the national learning outcomes and assessment standards.To support the holistic integration of separate science subjects into one, as foreseen in the new concept for primary education, UNICEF supported the creation of an experiential learning programme focused on environment and climate change, that enables students to practically engage with the topic with their teachers and apply their knowledge. UNICEF also supported the Science Learning Network, comprised of six science institutions in designing and offering a joint educational programme on environment and climate change, aligned with national curricula and verified by the Bureau for the Development of Education. This programme, developed with financial support from Sweden, helps students acquire practical experience about the environment and natural phenomena and how our behaviour impacts eco-systems. To complement these efforts, raise students’ knowledge of air pollution and support youth to get actively involved in processes at local level, UNICEF has also initiated the development of an experiential learning programme on air quality. UNICEF also established a partnership with the Vocational Training and Education Centre (VETC), initiating a greening revision of VET curricula, to support green skills development in students and facilitate the transitioning to a green economy. As of September 2023, all children with disabilities are enrolled in mainstream primary schools. One of the challenges schools are facing is to develop and implement the modified programme for working with children with moderate to severe learning disabilities. In response to this challenge, the Ministry of Education and Science established a collaborative working group with representatives from the resource centres, the Bureau for Development of Education, the ICF assessment commission, the body for monitoring the implementation of UNCRPD, primary schools and DPOs. UNICEF was invited to lead this group and to come up with recommendations for the necessary support required to assist teachers in developing and implementing the modified programme. UNICEF maintained regular meetings of the intersectoral steering committee tasked to oversee the entire Climate Change Education portfolio. This committee includes members of the Ministries of Education and Science, Labour and Social Policy, and Environment and Physical Planning. These partnerships extended on a technical level with specific units such as the Air Quality unit of the MoEPP, which is extremely beneficial for the sub-regional programme on Air Quality.To ensure system level support, a gap analysis of the services, capacities, and needs for providing mental health in education and social protection was conducted. The gap analysis results were used to draft the first National Action Plan for the mental health of adolescents in the country. UNICEF also led a group of professionals to develop a new counselling programme for parents and students adopted by the MoES. The programme primarily supports students who may display violent behaviour or, for various reasons, are not reaching their full academic potential. The school support involves focused efforts through individual and group counselling sessions with parents and students to overcome challenges and improve their mental well-being.UNFPA supported the data analysis of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study, and dissemination of the results at national and regional level. The national findings were presented at a conference organized by the project team at the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje premises, in the presence of numerous representatives of national institutions, relevant stakeholders, teachers, students, including Ms. Elizabeta Gjorgievska, spouse of the President of the Republic of North Macedonia. After the central conference, the dissemination of the results was initiated in all statistical regions within the country.Through the intervention, UNFPA set the baseline to create a platform for advocacy and promotion of youth wellbeing, addressing violence (including GBV), promoting constructive narratives, inclusion, and building trust among youth and their peers. By promoting findings, the rationale and need of integrating CSE in the educational process becomes even more evident, so that youth can receive age-appropriate credible information, to be able to undertake informed decisions about their life, health and their future.In partnership with the Macedonian Medical Association, UNFPA continued conducting educational-interactive workshops for high school students aged 15 to 18. Facilitated by a gynecology and obstetrics specialist and two actors, the workshops conveyed key messages: dispelling myths about sexual and reproductive health, promoting awareness of modern contraceptive methods and their benefits, underscoring the risks of unprotected sex, particularly regarding unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), emphasizing condoms as a readily available and dual-purpose contraception method guarding against both unwanted pregnancies and STIs, including HIV, and stressing the importance of regular gynecological examinations. More than 15 educational sessions around the country were conducted and were attended by more than 1200 students.

The SOPs were adopted by the Government at the start of the school year.As part of the joint programme with WHO, an action plan for mental health was developed, which included activities aimed at improving the mental health of students in primary and secondary education. This protocol was adopted by the Government in October 2024.The Bureau for Development of Education (BDE) was supported in developing nine programs for implementing extracurricular activities in primary education, aimed at enriching students’ experiences in areas of their interest. Additionally, the BDE was supported in creating a teaching program for implementing a community practice introduced with the primary education concept in 2020.UNFPA: two thematic reports, on peer violence between students at the age of 11, 13 and 15 in North Macedonia and sexual health and wellbeing of youth in North Macedonia were developed based on the HBSC study data with the support of UNFPA CO, which will be published and promoted in the first quarter of 2025. These reports will provide further evidence to support advocacy efforts and strengthen collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Science and the Bureau for Development of Education towards the integration of CSE in the national curriculum. UNFPA's support extended throughout the entire process from data collection and analysis, to visualization and dissemination of key findings on a national level. Advocacy efforts for CSE continued throughout Q4, through the dissemination of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study findings, through 14 sessions organized at 10 high schools in Skopje, facilitating discussions and raising awareness about youth and their wellbeing, SRHR, GBV and other CSE related topics among students, parents and teaching staff.","505000","174000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

UNICEF supported the decentralization of teacher in-service training contributing to the training of more than 1,500 teachers. The reform of the inclusive education system is underway with a series of capacity development sessions for 120 specialists. UNICEF, in partnership with Innovations for Inclusive Society, is supporting MoES to strengthen the quality of education for students with special education needs and/or disabilities by strengthening functional application of resource rooms at 10 public schools, introducing effective transition practices from general to vocational/higher education level, in partnership with 20 state and private vocational education institutions, and establishing school-based parent clubs.","1027850","500017","500017","The Parliament approved legislative amendments in the Law of General Education to formalize a new model of the inclusive education support system.

Continuing efforts in strengthening the capacities of universities in inclusive education, UNICEF supported the academic staff of seven state universities in further enhancing BA and MA programmes, with 25 professors going through a series of coaching sessions on inclusive education and reaching more than 315 teachers at 105 public schools. As a result of the cooperation between the universities and schools, four school-based Inclusive Education Centers have been established. The Centers have developed annual action plans and have hosted various training/workshops for teachers and students to advance inclusive education initiatives. UNICEF provided technical support to MoES and selected municipalities in the design of education programmes for children with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). After-school programmes for children with SEND, out-of-school children, and children at risk of dropping out of school were designed and modeled in selected public schools and Child Rights Centers. To date, 80 children with SEND and 50 children at risk of dropping out of school have been benefiting from educational and art activities; and 300 students and 100 teachers from public schools in Adjara have been engaged in the promotion of inclusive education culture in schools.UNICEF advocated for the approval of the Catch-up and Accelerated Learning Curriculum as part of the National Curriculum, thereby facilitating the integration of out-of-school children and those at-risk of dropping-out of school into mainstream education.","100000","79436","79436","The Parliament approved legislative amendments in the Law of General Education to formalize a new model of the inclusive education support system. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education, Science and Youth (MoESY) in developing a new model of an inclusive education support system to improve access to education for boys and girls, especially for children with disabilities, national minorities, and children who are not attending school or are at risk of dropping out. In 2023, the Parliament approved legislative amendments in the Law of General Education to formalize the new model of the inclusive education support system. In 2024, UNICEF supported MoESY to initiate implementation of the inclusive education support system with two major interventions: (1) capacitating 70 inclusive education specialists and (2) development (and revision) of different normative documents and instruments to be applied in the system for assessment of a child, for communication and cooperation between different actors (special teacher, parents and etc).With the support of Bulgarian Embassy, UNICEF in partnership with TPDC introduced and piloted after school catch-up programme for boys and girls at risk to drop-out of school. The programme was implemented in the Child Rights Centers of 3 state universities (Kutaisi, Gori and Zugdidi). UNICEF capacitated teachers and students involved in this programme through trainings, educational resources and guidelines.UNICEF, in collaboration with the Government of France, is supporting a consortium of three state universities in the development of Georgia’s first Master of Arts (MA) Programme in Child Rights. UNICEF, with the support of the Embassy of France and in partnership with Child Rights Centers of nine universities, conducted a skills mapping of youth to analyse learning competencies and skills needed to thrive in a complex, interconnected, and technology-driven environment. The mapping exercise covered ten competencies: literacy; multilingualism; science, technology, engineering and math (STEM); interpersonal skills, entrepreneurship, citizenship, digital skills, cultural awareness, green skills and mental health. The report outlines the main findings on areas where further interventions are needed to support adolescents to develop skills for learning, employment, personal and social development and active participation in the society.To enhance girls’ leadership, learning and skills, including digital skills, UNICEF Georgia supported 28 Youth Clubs in two regions, engaging 920 students (402 boys and 518 girls) on STEM, and strengthening their critical thinking and language skills. Objectives of the Youth Clubs are empowering youth through tailored informal education programmes, building skills in analyzing information and data, as well as strengthening communication and leadership skills. Youth Clubs also supported foreign language skills (English) to encourage dialogue and communication between different conflict-affected communities. In addition, in partnership with Business and Technology University (BTU), UNICEF empowered over 60 vulnerable youth (35 boys and 25 girls) in Tbilisi and Batumi with digital skills through eight-month training programme, including trainings and career bootcamps. Most of the young people were from socially vulnerable families; under state care and were selected by the State Care Agency; or selected by the Probation Department of the Ministry of Justice.","200000","25000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

As a result of the progressive advocacy, the two bodies for functional assessments based on the ICF, covering the Skopje region, and the National expert body for functional assessment that were created with UNICEF support were taken over by the state healthcare system. Namely, the Public Health Center (PHC) Skopje, opened a new Service for functional assessment of children and youth up to 26 years of age, and from January 2021 it started with provision of regular assessments of children and youth from the Skopje region. In the period May-October 2021, with support from UNICEF, training and mentoring on ICF-based functional assessments was conducted in Pelagonija, Polog and South-West regions, involving almost fifty professionals. With UNICEF advocacy the PHC Skopje has engaged twelve of the persons whose capacity has been developed to staff three new regional functional assessment bodies in Strumica, Bitola and Gostivar. UNICEF also supported fifteen workshops to present the new model for functional assessment to service providers – including Centers for Social Work (CSW), schools and kindergartens – as well as parents in the three targeted regions.

UNICEF coordinated with line ministries and other relevant institutions the drafting of amendments to the Social Protection Law, Child Protection Law, Health Insurance Law, Healthcare Law and Primary Education Law in order to consolidate the provision of functional assessments for children and youth in line with the ICF. The amendments were approved by the Government and were put on the agenda of Parliament in December 2021. UNICEF also supported the revision of the draft Rulebook on ICF-based disability assessments, so that it is aligned with the three line-ministries – Health, Education and Science, and Labour and Social Policy – as well as other relevant institutions. 

While UNICEF has supported the establishment of functional assessment bodies which cover four of the eight regions of North Macedonia, children and youth outside the covered regions could not complete such an assessment and were thus not eligible to obtain access to educational and personal assistants. This resulted in difficulties in exercising their right to education, as well as problems in carrying out their everyday activities. To address this, UNICEF supported the creation of a special team to conduct ICF-based disability assessment to children from vulnerable communities in locations that are not covered by the regional assessment bodies.","72297","72297","71084","In 2022 UNICEF developed national capacities for expansion of the human-rights based model of disability and needs assessment of children and youth in in the North-East, East, Vardar and South-West planning regions.

With UNICEF advocacy and support, the amendment to the Healthcare Law was adopted in Parliament, which ensured legal basis for the sustainability and the continued functioning of the functional assessment service, with a national and 10 regional functional assessment bodies for children and youth. UNICEF also supported the revision of the draft Rulebook on ICF-based disability assessments, so that it is aligned with the policies of the three line-ministries – Health, Education and Science, and Labour and Social Policy – as well as other relevant institutions.

At the national level, three key results have been achieved, namely:
  1. Launching the international ”Out of School Comprehensive Sexuality Education"" Guidance, which is now available in Romanian is already applied by professionals to develop the programs targeting specific groups like young people with disabilities, etc. https://moldova.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/ghid_educatia_sexuala_comprehensiva_extrascolara_unfpa_romanian.pdf
  2. The 3rd Annual National Conference on Health Education ”Strengthening the school environment for healthy and safe development of students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic” was successfully conducted online in collaboration with NGO ""Health for Youth"" and in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Research and Ministry of Health. 1700 participants were registered at the Conference, and a total of more than 16,000 views were accumulated on social networks.
 3. UNFPA conducted the assessment of the school-based mandatory curricula to assess the comprehensiveness of sexuality education, applying international methodology developed by UNESCO (SERAT tool). The results will be publicly presented in early 2022 and will guide further interventions at the national level to advance the quality and impact of CSE on young people's sexual and reproductive health behaviors.
4. Over 598 000 young people and adults were informed about the “Health Education” course through social media by diverse advocacy and informative materials and videos developed.  

However, to increase advocacy for CSE at the local level, the following key results were achieved in 5 targeted districts (Cahul, Orhei, Rezina, Falesti and Unghnei):
 1. Five new communities joined the UNFPA Programme, as result, since 2018, 45 communities with advocacy groups (including school representatives, young people, parents, and religious leaders) supporting adolescents and youth sexual and reproductive health and rights and advocate for mandatory health education course which includes comprehensive sexuality education. 
2. 618 new key actors in 5 targeted districts (parents, teachers, young people, etc.) are aware of youth SRHR including the right to CSE/HE, after 10 Let’s Talk events. Since 2018 in total 9816 people/stakeholders have been reached. 
3. Ten local initiatives that promote health education and a healthy environment in schools were supported by UNFPA.

The main partner of UNFPA for raising awareness at the national level and advocacy platform at the local level is the Youth Media Center.

Joint work allowed to align the Concept with international guidelines and better define the strategic directions, mechanisms, and conditions for the formation of universal competencies of children and young people at different levels of education. The Concept embraced the general framework of the universal 21st century competencies developed within Belarus educational system, with a particular focus on social-emotional skills (SES). Based on the Concept, an Action Plan to build SES in Children and Young People for 2023-2026 was drafted. The Action Plan clearly defined the main interventions and implementing partners for each block and was submitted to the MOE for endorsement.International expertise was highly appreciated by the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the Republican Institute of Professional Education (RIPE) during development of the SES ME tool comprising 25 criteria and 94 indicators to measure 3 main SES components: emotional regulation, communication, and cooperation. The ME tool was co-created with adolescents from technical vocational colleges who provided recommendations and feedback. The tool will be piloted in 2024.To ensure the quality and sustainability of the SES integration in the education process the SES normative framework was supplemented by development of an in-service training programme for general secondary and technical vocational education teachers and methodological recommendations for different groups (e.g. teachers, administrations, parents) on how to integrate SES in the education process in schools and colleges.The in-service training programme for pedagogues was complemented with a curriculum for an elective courses on advancement of social-emotional skills among 3-4th and 6th-7th grade students and trainer guide developed by the NIE.

As part of the project, a training of trainers workshop was organized to consolidate the implementation of the program and ensure its more effective expansion. The social and emotional learning programme was consolidated, by expanding the pool of trainers and by focusing on the schools at highest risk of peer violence. By the end of 2023, over 34,000 children in 110 primary and secondary schools have benefitted from the programme.

A new challenge that schools have been faced with mostly due to the Ukraine refugee crisis is how to accommodate and provide quality support to the increasing number of children from other countries. In several municipalities the number of children, non-speakers of Montenegrin, is reaching almost 30 per cent of the whole primary school population.

Furthermore, the social and emotional learning program was further expanded to 114 schools, reaching almost 46,000 children.To improve the quality of education and care for Roma children in preschools, outreach visits to Roma settlements were organized and a set of trainings launched for preschool and primary school teachers in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science, and Innovation. By the end of the first quarter 2025, at least 90 preschool staff will have improved their capacity to support Roma children, and at least 700 teachers will be trained to use the MEIS based application for Early Identification of Children at Risk of Dropping-Out, as well as for the use of digital technologies in quality and inclusive manner.Also, in cooperation with the Bureau for Education, comprehensive activities are currently being implemented to improve the quality of educational services for children with disabilities in preschools and the first three grades of primary education.

As a result, nearly 6000 teachers were directly supported with practical tools, guides, trainings and educational resources that facilitate their practical work.UNICEF also supported the development of over 200 high quality resources for students and teachers, including videos, virtual experiments, educational activities, and digital games. All of these resources were tested among teachers as part of 93 professional learning communities. As a result, in the reporting period, thousands of practical activities and experiments were organized across the country, allowing 35.722 children from kindergartens and primary schools to understand complex environment and climate-related concepts through interesting hands-on activities tailored to their age.30 teachers from preschool and 91 teachers from primary school education attended intensive in-person trainings on how to teach and integrate environment and climate change education in their classes using experiential learning (experiments and practical activities). Additional 53 teachers were engaged in a pilot testing and workshop to verify the experiments and activities. 93 teachers who the attended intensive in-person trainings actively organized and delivered peer learning sessions (Professional Learning Communities), reaching at least 1038 colleagues. Through online courses – Eduino webinars a total of 4647 were trained on 1) problem solving methodology in teaching climate change; and 2) using the Eduino Virtual Laboratory in their practice. To further support the use and integration of the educational resources mentioned above, 3 Teacher guides on experiential learning – with activity guides were developed, as were 15 digital teacher guides for experiments developed and uploaded on Eduino Virtual Laboratory.

In 2021  UNDP continued to support development of the institution and assist SASC with the swiss knowledge transfer activities for implementing the dual model aiming to transform existing supply-driven VET system towards a demand-led model to meet industry needs for the skilled workforce. 

UNDP VET project continues active partnership and collaboration with the governmental institutions and key stakeholders of vocational education in Georgia to support development of extension services for farmers. In 2021, UNDP was engaged in process of elaboration the New Extension Strategy of Ministry of Environmental protection and Agriculture of Georgia (MEPA) reassuring once more the commitment to promote quality of extension services to improve standards and mechanisms of knowledge dissemination accessible for small farmers. In the same vein UNDP contributed to launching digital extension platform http://regions.mepa.gov.ge in 4 regions for further national upscale, which would potentially reach 40% of farmers countrywide. This platform will contribute to increasing the volume and quality of the extension service provided in the regions, as farmers’ queries will be directed to relevant specialized government agencies able to provide qualified advice. In parallel UNDP supported establishing Farmers’ Extension Boards countrywide. By end of  2021, 21 operations Farmers Extension Boards are in place and functioning, including 3 new extension boards in Guria region that has been recently added to the pilot scheme. 

Under `VET College Development` component UNDP supported elaboration and formalization of 21 regulatory documents and authorized corporate standards for 8 VET-profile colleges. Additionally, 5 VET colleges were supported to elaborate their strategic documents.

UNDP VET project continues strengthening private sector service providers and educational opportunities for farmers.  Similar to other private companies and NGOs (Farmers school, Tabco, Akhazintercont, etc.) supported earlier, the newly established NGO `Qvevris Mze` was supported in elaborating educational training courses (STT) in winemaking using `Kvevri technology` in Kakheti region. 42 private companies joined PPP, including the `Work Based Learning` (WBL) scheme and are involved in the implementation process

As a supplementary contribution to improvement of livelihood of rural population, VET project supported acquisition and installation of 3 meteorological stations in 3 regions (Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Samtskhe-Javakheti regions). Access to more on-spot and precise meteorological data and prognosis will significantly improve farmers’ efficiency to plan and conduct agricultural activities as well as informational exchange and communication among the local agri-communities.

Finally, raising awareness of wider population on environment and climate smart (green) agriculture was one of the direction of UNDP’s work in 2021. UNDP assisted Environmental Information and Education Centre` in elaboration of comprehensive educational module on `climate-smart agriculture`, which is designed for all agri-profile colleges and institutions at national level. In its efforts to popularize agriculture among schoolchildren children and youth, UNDP supported launching of `Agri-Clubs in 4 municipal schools of Racha-Lechkhumi region, which will provide children with general agricultural education and practical knowledge of gardening and other agri-fields from local farmers and agri-experts.

Further, the UNDP program assisted in enhancing the Performance Management System for VET Colleges by developing standards for VET principals and 360-degree evaluations allowing colleges to conduct digital self-assessments of their service quality. UNDP was instrumental in attracting and retaining young people in agriculture by assisting RDA in establishing and institutionalizing the new internship system for agriculture students at extension services. UNDP continued advancing the transformation of Georgia's agricultural extension system by assisting in the establishment of professional qualifications and the development of the pilot version of its professional growth system. UNDP nurtured a new partnership involving the Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture (MEPA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the NCEQE, the Business Association of Georgia (BAG), industry associations, processing enterprises, farmers, and non-governmental organizations which resulted in the development of a policy document on the Employment in Competitive Fields; this policy paper identifies deficient environmental and agriculture professions and outlines the government mechanisms for ensuring high-paying employment in these vocations. The document has been submitted to MEPA, and its enforcement into a Law is expected in the coming months. In 2024 UNDP achieved significant advancements in providing extension services to a total of 14,809 farmers, of whom 4,014 are women, across targeted regions, including Guria, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Ajara. Furthermore, UNDP facilitated services for 1,632 Agrarian Vocational Education and Training (A-VET) students, including 506 women, through both A-VET and Adult Education (AE) initiatives. Two notable contributions have been made towards establishing a Vocational Education and Training (VET) system that is more inclusive and aligned with labor market demands: (1) the implementation of an Ethnic Youth Integration Plan in two selected regions of Georgia, which enables 41 general education schools to offer VET courses tailored to ethnic minority communities and populations residing across the occupation line; and (2) the completion of a final draft for a concept regarding an institutionalized social inclusion fund. Additionally, comprehensive concepts focusing on the integration of NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) and ethnic minority youth have been developed, which will serve to guide institutions in enhancing access to both education and employment opportunities. To improve the inclusivity and accessibility of vocational education and training, particularly for rural and ethnic minority groups, the UNDP has undertaken several initiatives: a) the development of a revised version of the State Language Program, aimed at facilitating better integration and enhancing the social and economic engagement of ethnic minority youth; and b) the creation of a training package for Georgian as a Second Language (GSL), consisting of 60 audio files. UNDP assisted in enhancing Performance Management System for VET Colleges: the National Center for Education Quality Enhancement (NCEQE) has developed standards for vocational education and training (VET) principals, contributing to improved performance management in VET colleges. A comprehensive concept and digital tools for 360-degree evaluations have been developed, allowing VET colleges to conduct digital self-assessments of their service quality.UNDP also assisted in digitalization of the registration process for Sector Skills Organizations (SSOs) and training enterprises; implementation of a pilot blended training model for extension specialists that incorporates online learning resources; enhancement of the network of educators through the provision of online coaching sessions; formulation of a comprehensive concept aimed at the digital transformation of VET institutions, with a particular emphasis on developing digital infrastructure, enhancing management practices, and promoting innovative pedagogical approaches. Enrollment in Work-Based Learning (WBL) programs has tripled, reaching a total of 156 participants. Vocational education admissions have seen an impressive fourteenfold increase, totaling 35,457 enrollments. Additionally, the number of vocational education graduates employed in agriculture has exceeded expectations, with 595 graduates, surpassing the initial target by 1.4 times. Notably, the percentage of women benefiting from these programs significantly exceeds the targeted 30%. UNDP has made substantial improvements in the qualifications of teachers and extensionists, with 229 individuals (41% women) as extension officers and 117 individuals (77% women) as agricultural vocational education and training (A-VET) teachers. This development was facilitated through regular online quarterly meetings, coaching, and training in areas such as ""Lettuce Production,"" ""Demo Farming,"" ""Basics of Agricultural Cooperative Management,"" and ""Potato Production."" Furthermore, 47 field specialists and farmers (12 women) completed the training certificate requirements based on International Standards in Agriculture. UNDP has also achieved important milestones in developing examination requirements for dairy production and formalizing the application of the European Quality Assurance in Vocational Education and Training (EQAVET) indicators among VET providers. Additionally, progress has been made in implementing a Micro-AKIS concept in the Imereti and Guria regions. The development plans for the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in these regions, covering the years 2025-2030, have been completed and presented to stakeholders, with participation from 35 individuals (14 women) in Guria and 30 individuals (20 women) in Imereti. The UNDP has implemented effective interventions to support students, farmers, and vocational education and training (VET) institutions, helping them acquire the skills necessary for preparing business plans. In collaboration with the Swiss Agricultural School Caucasus (SASC), UNDP has introduced a work-based learning examination process and established an Alumni Support Fund to assist graduates in launching and managing agricultural businesses. As a result, three A-VET graduates have received financial support of up to $3,000 each to help kickstart their ventures. In order to promote agricultural education among youth, together with 20 educational organizations, UNDP provided Agro-scholarships to 32 students (including 14 women) in amounts of 500, 1,000, or 1,500 GEL. Another noteworthy initiative is the Agriculture and Environmental Protection Olympiad, held on the platform www.http://agroliga.veta.ge. This competition saw participation from 313 young individuals (146 of whom were women), from which 18 winners (10 women) emerged, each receiving various forms of rewards and recognition.  Extension services were promoted among youth by implementing and institutionalizing internships for vocational and higher education students at extension services, offering three-month paid placements. Namely, internship opportunities for vocational and higher education students were offered in six pilot regions in Georgia. More than 100 students will benefit from a three-month paid internship program. Moreover, UNDP has launched a new rural skills development initiative in partnership with the Pakka Foundation, focusing on field training and mentorship for farmers in organic hazelnut cultivation techniques in Kakheti and Samegrelo. To date, Pakka has trained 79 farmers (12 women) with the assistance of field advisers and international organic farming specialists, successfully testing six new techniques alongside farmers involved in demo plots. UNDP further supported increased representation of the private sector in the VET System: The agricultural Sector Skills Organization (SSO) AgroDuo has expanded its membership by enrolling participants from the meat processing and veterinary sectors while providing needs-based training for leaders, trainers, and specialists; and has continued to strengthen the foundational aspects of the skills hub concept which enhances the private sector power in the development of educational standards and programs.

Through small-grant program, 10 Georgian and South Ossetian women, 21 families or 82 members of the communities increased their monthly income and created services or products, which served more than 900 indirect beneficiaries from target communities and beyond. Young people from vulnerable groups gained better access to local job markets through undergoing digitalized VET courses offered by Sukhumi-based CSO National Resources and Tbilisi-based CSO Innovative Education Foundation. UNDP supported the economic empowerment of conflict-affected communities, including women by providing entrepreneurship training, mentorship, and in-kind contributions. 80 beneficiaries received training and grants for equipment to support their entrepreneurial activities.  Three road infrastructure repair tasks completed in Abkhazia have significantly improved access to public services for 815 rural residents (66% women). 88% also reported an increase in use of public services. This also significantly reduced travel time, cutting school trip for one community from 40 to 10 minutes. UNDP improved access to digital skills and STEM education for 300 young people in Abkhazia (60% female). This was achieved by providing spaces with IT equipment in the Sukhum/i Boarding School and Gal/i College of Humanities. Further 72 young people (82% girls) increased their employability by obtaining various IT skills through specialized trainings. UNDP contributed to improving access to quality healthcare services for rural conflict-affected communities. Six clinics were renovated and equipped with necessary furniture and medical equipment, including a full rehabilitation of the Ambulance and SES premises at Gali Hospital, rehabilitation works at the Polyclinic in New Athos, and Clinical-Diagnostic Laboratory in Agudzera in Abkhazia, as well as full rehabilitation of outpatient clinics alongside ABLs on TAT, Mejvriskhevi, Rike and Orsantia clinics. In total, around 45,000 conflict-affected people benefit from the newly renovated medical premises.  As part of the Referral Program, from January to September (including), 590 patients (401 women) from Abkhazia/South Ossetia received emergency or planned medical care on the TAT including the diagnosis and medication, and support with transportation and accommodation for patients and their family members.","1325000","1325000","1316452","  Throughout 2024 UNDP continued to provide access to essential social services, such as education and healthcare, as well as improving infrastructure for conflict-affected population.Healthcare: UNDP contributed to improving access to quality healthcare services for IDP communities. UNDP supported the establishment of a Day Hospital (emergency room) in Tskaltubo to serve the local and IDP populations, providing vital medical consultations and testing services within the community. This initiative has raised awareness of prevalent illnesses, symptoms, and treatment options among both IDPs and local residents, improving health knowledge and access to care. Enhanced healthcare services reduce barriers to treatment, contributing to a higher quality of life in Tskaltubo Municipality and potentially lowering morbidity and mortality rates. During the grant implementation period, a total of 1,850 individuals benefited. Of these, 415 were direct beneficiaries, including medical personnel, patients, and community meeting participants (103 men, 312 women, and 88 IDPs), and 1,345 were indirect beneficiaries, such as family members and potential patients (344 men and 1,001 women).UNDP organized activities as part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence in five IDP settlements. These included an information session with doctors, a Forum Theater for social change, and active engagement of IDP women in theater performances, all aimed at raising awareness about GBV, legal protection, and support services. The campaign mobilized IDP women and youth, promoting collective action and fostering a more equitable society. Throughout the mentioned activities, a total number of 227 beneficiaries were directly outreached and engaged.  As part of the Referral Program, from January to June (including), 178 patients (114 women) from Abkhazia/South Ossetia received emergency or planned medical care on the TAT including the diagnosis and medication, and support with transportation and accommodation for patients and their family members. UNDP also supported an umbrella network in the sphere of healthcare and support to PWDs which brought benefit to 278 (118F) vulnerable people, including PWDs and victims of gender-based violence. Results of 17 CSO grants provided by UNDP’s Civil Society Support Programme (CSSP) include: improving access to quality healthcare for 446 PWDs (237F, 209 M), including children, through services delivered at various rehabilitation centers across Abkhazia as well as psychiatric consultations for boys and girls; providing support to over 50 rural families living in extreme poverty to build their capacities to independently produce agricultural products in an environmentally-conscious way; socialization of 8 PWDs through one-day tours aimed at learning how to live a healthy lifestyle and appreciate nature, and; providing medical support to over 15 elderly people, PWDs and other vulnerable persons through outpatient medical service. Overall, in 2024, over 2500 conflict affected people were directly supported. Infrastructure improvements in 2024 entailed significant work carried out in IDP collective centers and conflict-affected communities. These efforts included bathroom repairs, water supply enhancements, and roof rehabilitation, benefiting over 1,082 internally displaced people living in 21 IDP settlements.  Through the EU4Dialogue project, 42 families in the Torsa IDP settlement regained access to safe drinking water. This initiative included comprehensive repairs to critical water infrastructure, reducing significant water loss and enhancing sustainable water access. Key improvements encompassed restoring water headworks and distribution pumps, installing tanks and filters, and conducting rigorous water quality testing. Additionally, community members participated in water hygiene training, and a village water committee was established to ensure ongoing maintenance and system sustainability. This project has effectively raised awareness of water safety and improved living conditions within the Torsa settlement, contributing to a healthier, more resilient community.  UNDP supported the water well construction in the Ingiri village IDP settlement, providing the IDP population with a reliable and systematic drinking water supply (110 IDPs - 63 women, 47 men, incl. 5 PwDs). Water pumping units and an extensive supply system were installed. Two local community members, selected to manage the water system, completed an intensive internship and are now qualified to operate the technical panel with safety and expertise. The initiative has resolved long-standing water access issues, eliminating life-threatening conditions and ensuring that residents can now live in accordance with sanitary and hygiene standards. Additionally, an extra pump was installed in the basement of the residential building to manage accumulated water, further enhancing living conditions for the IDP families. UNDP supported socio-economic and hygiene improvements in the Tsilkani IDP settlement by upgrading 11 cottage ceilings, installing solar water heaters and dryers, and training seven residents in sustainable energy management. These upgrades, benefiting 200 residents (124 women), reduced energy costs by an average of 28%, with a new energy cooperative established to promote local leadership in energy solutions. UNDP helped install a solar-powered bench in the settlement for internally displaced people in Senaki, offering renewable energy for mobile devices and a free Internet connection. The direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project already have the opportunity to use the free internet 24/7 in their settlement, through which they have maintained access to everything that they did not have before for example, they have learned to use Google, use various searches engines, which they actively use in their practice. beneficiaries included 1500 people, who used the free Wi-Fi during the initiative period.  UNDP has successfully supplied a low-maintenance incinerator for the Gali hospital including building a concrete platform and metal shelter to keep the incinerator secure. The initiative contributed to enhancing bio-medical waste management and environmental standards in Abkhazia. This advancement reduces infection risks within the hospital and provides Abkhazia’s medical and environmental sectors with a sustainable solution for disposing of bio-medical waste from various sources, including other hospitals and animal remains. These improvements contribute to the safety and quality of life for conflict-affected communities by ensuring better healthcare and environmental protection. Additionally, UNDP fostered personal connections between Georgian and Abkhaz doctors, offering promising potential for future cooperation. The incinerator benefited 350 patients (50% women) and is expected to serve thousands of beneficiaries over the coming years.  UNDP has provided the Nikozi outpatient clinic, located in an ABL village, with solar panels to address rising electricity costs and improve service reliability. As the clinic expanded its medical services, its operational expenses, including an annual electricity cost of approximately 3,500 GEL, also increased. Frequent power outages and fluctuations have affected the quality of medical equipment and imposed additional expenses, placing a burden on the clinic’s budget. The newly installed solar power system is expected to provide a reliable, uninterrupted power source, reducing electricity costs and ensuring consistent healthcare delivery. Serving around 5,000 residents in the Nikozi community, the clinic is the sole healthcare provider in the area, making this initiative vital to the well-being of local families and communities. UNDP has empowered marginalized populations in conflict-affected communities by offering access to business education, vocational education and training (VET) courses, and agricultural services. Namely, UNDP supported vocational handicraft classes for 54 women from ABL villages in Samegrelo, enhancing skills in knitting, digital marketing, and social media. Six women secured employment, and four are now conducting master classes in local schools, with six others obtaining grants to support their businesses. Additionally, technical equipment was provided to IDP settlements, enabling 90 women to become skilled in craft-making and promoting their work online to secure independent income. In the Imereti and Racha regions, around 270 (156 women) IDPs received training in business planning and funding opportunities, with 14 participants submitting applications and two successfully funded. Overall, UNDP through the EU4Dialoge project provided socio-economic and livelihood support to 1,831 people (1,121 women). These were vulnerable people including IDPs, rural and conflict-affected communities.  As part of VET support, digitalization and digital literacy was promoted through cross-district knowledge sharing: Sukhum-based IT trainers conducted training at Gal College of Humanities and Sukhum Boarding School, utilizing newly equipped IT classrooms. This initiative provided 44 VET students (24F) with essential IT skills, opening up future career paths in a technology-driven world. Additionally, 32 VET teachers (all female) enhanced their ICT literacy, empowering them to better support student learning. This grant underscores the transformative role of technology in education, equipping youth with skills vital for career development and adaptability in a digital age UNDP enhanced the skills of 19 (3F) young people from remote areas of Abkhazia and TaT by introducing advanced agricultural techniques and smart rural technologies. This included providing smart devices to help automize and improve greenhouse production; thus, increasing sustainable income for target rural groups in Abkhazia and TaT UNDP facilitated access to higher education for 9 (6F) conflict-affected youth residing in Abkhazia to study in France and Estonia. Given the challenges posed by international travel restrictions and the limited eligibility of Abkhaz students for Western scholarship programs, fully funded educational opportunities in the EU have a transformative impact on the personal and professional development of these young people.

In parallel, industry organizations will have the capacity to leverage the Guidelines to establish safer and more secure services tailored for children. Simultaneously, parents and educators will gain valuable insights to assist them in recognizing potential threats and risks children might encounter online. This guidance will empower them to preempt and effectively address these challenges in a timely manner.2) In partnership with IT-Park Uzbekistan, the course materials ‘Information Security in Digital Education Space’, developed jointly by the ITU Regional Office for CIS and the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education, were successfully adapted to the national context and translated into Uzbek. An online course on information security (available at cop-itpark.uz) is specifically designed to provide training for teachers and individuals who engage with children in their professional roles, and it is offered free of charge. Moreover, online course has built-in accessibility features, that allow users with disabilities to successfully complete it. It consists of several modules covering the following topics: information security issues, basic legislation in the field of information technology and information protection, the relationship between the use of digital devices and children's mental health, organizing children's information security behavior in the digital space, cyber hygiene and cyber security for students, computer viruses and analysis of software products aimed at ensuring children's information security in the digital educational space. Upon successful completion of the course, each participant receives a certificate that attests to their accomplished training and signifies their capability to apply the acquired knowledge in their everyday undertakings.3) 305 teachers (275 men and 30 women) from 14 regions of Uzbekistan, affiliated with IT Parks and IT-Academies, were trained on information security during a series of offline trainings. The trained instructors will apply their newfound knowledge over the next six months while teaching IT courses, thereby imparting the fundamentals of online child protection to their students on a consistent basis.4) ITU provided expert assistance to Uzbekistan on addressing challenges related to broadband Internet connectivity at schools, network resiliency and monitoring quality of service. The following national studies are carried out by ITU experts in this area: (a) study on the actual use and quality of Internet connectivity in schools; (b) study on the resilience of LAN infrastructure in schools. In 2023, a methodology for each study was developed and initial data was collected.5) In February and September 2023, 7 representatives of IT Park Uzbekistan took part in online training 'ITU tools for connecting schools to the Internet' (participants gained knowledge and practical skills about the most promising technologies for school connectivity, ITU tools to be used to estimate capital and operating costs in all sections of the telecommunications network (incl. school LAN), mapping and analysing broadband network infrastructure) and ITU regional event 'Broadband Week: connecting schools - expanding the opportunities of education of tomorrow!'  held in Kostanay, Kazakhstan (participants discussed policy and regulatory aspects of school connectivity and gained knowledge and practical skills on technological and economic aspects of broadband school connectivity).","15000","0","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Over 6,500 preschool teachers and managers have benefited from the newly developed in-service teacher training curricula in 2024 and over 119,000 will go through the new in-service teacher training system based on the new curricula over the next five years. This was made available through the technical support provided by UNICEF in the framework of IsDB funded “Enhancing Quality of ECE in Uzbekistan” Project and teacher professional system reforms happening based on the Presidential Resolution # 231 of June 2024 devoted to improvement of the system of continuous professional development of teachers, which envisaged creation of integrated system of retraining and professional development of employees of educational organizations. Total of 11 Regional Teacher Training Centers to be established nationwide have been identified and UNICEF has started procurement of goods to fully equip the first five Centers to accommodate all teachers through in-service training at regional level within five coming years.   Curriculum development for preschool teachers and methodologists. Based on the technical recommendations of the international experts and the work of the appointed working groups, the curricula for teachers and methodologists have been reviewed and revised from 144 hours into two training pathways: a 100-hour in-person program and a 72-hour online course. The in-person program uses hands-on methods for child-centered learning, managing diverse classrooms and promoting social and emotional growth with big emphasis on practical implementation. The introduction of the online courses will give flexibility through digital tools for easy access. Over 25,700 teachers are currently using the Learning Passport platform and the new curriculum was approved to start implementation from 2025. The syllabi for the new curricula are being revised and developed accordingly and will be finalized by the beginning of the courses to start in 2025. Curriculum development for pre-schools Directors. In alignment with the Cabinet of Ministers’ Resolution #531, which mandates enhanced leadership training for preschool directors, new certified managerial courses were developed at the request of the MOPSE. UNICEF provided technical support in the development of the curriculum for Directors for 144 hours through the review and analysis of their managerial, pedagogical and motivational competencies and needs necessary to lead well in a fast-changing environment.  The curriculum was approved and is being pretested in December for full implementation starting January 2025. ","640000","640000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

New funding formulas based on the number of students and costs for attaining educational standards were developed and incorporated in the 2022 national budget, increasing efficiency, improving funding transparency and fairness and establishing mechanisms that would enhance quality of teaching. Adequate allocations are also made for inclusion of children with disabilities as well as for teaching in the languages of the smaller ethnic communities. The new formulas provide sufficient funding to schools for adequate maintenance, suitable investment in equipment and teaching aids, professional training and career development of the school staff, as well as increased number of professional associates. For the first time, the 2022 primary education funds transferred to the municipalities, prepared based on the funding formulas developed with UNICEF support, include free meals for students from first to fifth grade thus further expanding universal social protection programmes for children, as well as free tablets for access to digital educational resources for students from families at social risk. 

UNICEF has also supported the drafting of municipal school optimization plans, which aim to identify potential ways to improve the allocation of the limited resources to ensure all primary schools enable teaching in accordance with national standards, laws and educational concepts. UNICEF has supported the development of a school optimization index which measures the gaps for each primary school and municipality to fulfil the educational and infrastructural standards, as well as the gaps in actual costs per student and standardized costs – unveiling the level of financial efficiency. For each municipality where action is needed, a detailed plan is prepared for adjusting the infrastructural and educational capacity, while the financial efficiency will be improved with the use of the new school funding formula. The implementation of these plans will: establish an equitable system for primary education; create equal conditions for teaching in all the schools; implement the new concept of primary education; ensure efficient allocation of resources.","67000","67000","62303","In cooperation with the World Bank and the MoES, UNICEF supported the drafting of 80 municipal plans for optimization of the network of primary schools, and commenced work with 10 municipalities to collect and update data needed for the finalization of the optimization plans, as well as consultation with local stakeholders – municipal administration, school staff, parents and students – to adjust optimization scenarios. UNICEF developed the capacity of key Ministry of Education and Science personnel to understand the methodology and key findings from the analyses related to primary school optimization and funding reform, including the school optimization index. In line with the new primary education funding allocation formula and the drive for optimizing the primary school network and its resources, UNICEF supported the MoES and the Bureau for Development of Education to revise the standards for primary schools – updating infrastructure and equipment benchmarks for schools to be able to provide good quality education. The standards provide crucial parameters in the calculation primary education funding allocations, and during the development of the new funding formula it become apparent that they are outdated and need to be revised. The primary education transfers formula has been further upgraded by incorporating costs for implementation of mandatory experiential learning, which will enable even students from poorer households to take part in these activities.","200000","24236","24236","A UNICEF international forum brought together policymakers, experts, thought leaders and practitioners to engage in a dialogue on lessons learned and key success factors from school network optimisation in European countries. The Forum was used to transfer lessons learned from similar reforms conducted in EU Member States, and to also bring in expertise and additional support in the process from the OECD and the World Bank. UNICEF established partnership with the Association of municipalities (ZELS) around the issue of school funding reform and school network optimization. The partnership includes advocacy for a new primary education funding formula, gathering feedback from the municipalities to inform its fine-tuning, and developing their capacities to implement it and develop primary school network optimization plans. ","59744","59744","59744","UNICEF supported national and local authorities in optimizing the primary school network and improving resource allocation. The detailed plans for 10 municipalities were updated, and stakeholder consultations for finalizing optimization plans for other 24 municipalities commenced. Three municipalities started implementing the optimization plans, and unused school spaces were repurposed for ECEC and community services. UNICEF prepared an assessment of investment needs to implement the optimization plans in 80 municipalities and engaged in advocacy to secure the needed $120 million. The new Minister of Education and Science endorsed the national methodology for primary education transfers to municipalities, initiated with the previous Government and supported by UNICEF and World Bank. The Ministry of Finance incorporated it in the Government’s Mid-Term Fiscal Strategy, projecting a 38% increase in operational expenditures over five years ($90 million). The new formula aims to ensure adequate funding for diverse educational needs, incentivize reducing dropout rates, expand extracurricular activities, and reallocate resources to improve efficiency and quality of education.  Advocacy resulted in the Government including the adoption of the formulas for primary and secondary education transfers to municipalities in the EU Growth Plan for the country.

The trainings were delivered in Kazakh language. In 2022 UNFPA assessed the student’s knowledge about life skills and SRH before and after the course. The assessment demonstrated its high effectiveness and proved that the lessons at schools are the main source of information related to the sexuality education. Along with this it should be noted that from the beginning of the lessons at schools there were resistances both from the parent community as well as from teachers.

In total, 2327 VET students have been reached by peer educators since September 2020 when the Network was established.  

To ensure the quality of peer education activities, peer educators have passed a complex training program, which also included an offline summer camp. They have learned about healthy nutrition, prevention of bullying and GBV, sexuality, and changes in puberty, HIV and STIs prevention, prevention of teenage pregnancy, etc. Due to the extended COVID-19 period and restrictions for offline events, to ensure meaningful and equitable engagement of peer educators they have been equipped with tablets and the internet. 
The Network of Peer Educators teamed up with Pupils Council in VET and jointly organized an informational Campaign on preventing HIV/AIDS starting with December 1st.

In addition, 190 school technical staff, teachers and schoolchildren from Tashkent and Termez cities, Chirchiq, Yuqorichirchiq, Kasansai and Bulungur districts improved their knowledge and understanding about the importance of accessing clean and safe drinking water, adequate and accessible sanitation facilities, proper hygiene practices, regular handwashing, proper waste disposal, and functionality and cleanliness of WASH facilities in schools in emergencies. They were also involved in behaviour change exercises linked to promoting and practising effective WASH habits in emergencies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and create a healthier learning environment.","60000","60000","60000","Development of country specific GBV risk mitigation strategy and capacity development in GiE and GBV risk mitigation·        UNICEF in Uzbekistan organized two workshops in Tashkent and Samarkand for 50 national stakeholders, representatives of the education sector and the Ministry of Emergency Situations dedicated to building capacity on the GBV safety audit tool through the lens of GBV prevention, gender awareness and prevention of GBV in emergencies. In addition, UNICEF in Uzbekistan led a brainstorming session on gender barriers to integrating gender into national emergency plans.Development and testing of a well-functioning gender-responsive complaint and feedback mechanism (AAP)·        In Uzbekistan, UNICEF developed and tested a well-functioning gender response complaint and feedback mechanism to ensure accountability to affected populations. The Uzbekistan disaster response framework, including the government tools and systems for AAP/CEA, was reviewed to identify entry points for incorporating and managing the feedback and complaint mechanism. This review helped map out the strengths and gaps of the existing AAP/CEA systems, including their alignment with international standards and the extent to which the tools and systems are accessible to all affected populations, including vulnerable groups. The review also reflected on inclusivity, gender, language and cultural sensitivity. The proposed new and improved tools were presented to the staff of MES and RCSU.Disaster and Climate Risk Reduction (DRR): DRR interventions and school safety enhance preparedness for possible disasters and reduce their impact on children and their communities. ·        Ten schools, namely: School No. 17 and School No. 25 in Samarkand Region, School No. 83 and School No. 154 in Tashkent city, School No. 2 and School No. 35 in Tashkent Region, School No. 1 and Boarding School No. 45 (a school for visually impaired children) in Namangan Region, and School No. 7 and School No. 26 in Surkhandarya Region, have been identified as the most vulnerable schools in the target regions.·        2,380 school administrators and teachers (1270 female, 1110 male) were trained in DRM, climate action, reducing non-structural risks, and inclusive and gender-sensitive approaches in school DRM planning.·        School DRR teams were established in each school, and risk and vulnerability assessments were conducted to determine the climatic-geographical, socio-economic, and engineering-technical features of those vulnerable regions and target schools.·        An inclusive school DRM and Climate Action training package was introduced to schools through workshops, seminars, simulation exercises, and evacuation drills.·        School DRM plans were developed and non-structural risks were assessed with the engagement of teachers and students.·        1,715 students (787 girls and 928 boys, including 72 boys and 48 girls with disabilities) benefited from their engagement and participation in the school DRR learning and practicing interventions.Youth Engagement: Young volunteers, adolescent girls and boys in disaster risk-prone areas engaged in community DRR, climate change, disaster preparedness and comprehensive school safety.  In Uzbekistan, UNICEF partnered with ICP to engage young volunteers, adolescent girls and boys in ten selected target schools from Tashkent and Termez cities, Chirchiq, Yuqorichirchiq, Kasansai and Bulungur districts in community DRR, climate change adaptation, disaster preparedness, and comprehensive school safety. Three-day training seminars were organized in Tashkent and Samarkand for 45 teachers from target schools in two cohorts on 21st-century skills, time management, stress management, DRR and climate change. Furthermore, ICP organized five training seminars for 232 (125 boys, 107 girls) adolescent girls and boys, members of newly established School DRR clubs in each target school for engaging in community resilience and school safety, including search and rescue operations and first aid. 125 volunteers of RCSU, in turn, supported the School DRR Clubs to conduct simulations and drills on how to act in emergency situations. Finally, the trained teachers and RCSU volunteers organized seminars on youth engagement and action planning for the school DRR club members. As a result, the schoolchildren from the School DRR Clubs in the target schools engaged in community and school observations, interviews with teachers, parents and community members, and reviews of school preparedness plans. The School DRR Club members developed their school hazard profiles, drafted action plans to improve disaster preparedness, and showcased them to the school community members.Shock Responsive Social Protection: Support the development of coordination, governance, financing, and/or programme design for social protection in emergencies in all five Central Asian countries. In Uzbekistan, UNICEF supported the government to strengthen preparedness of the national humanitarian and social protection systems to respond to shocks through several activities. This includes: (1)  Updating an assessment of the national system’s readiness to activate emergency cash support protocols to reach affected households. The assessment has been accomplishing using the CADRI Social Protection Assessment tool with a combination of desk review and key informant interviews. The final report suggests on potential opportunities, barriers, and detailed recommendations (along policy, programmatic, systems, and related dimensions) for improving the delivery of humanitarian cash transfers in Uzbekistan. (2)  in-depth review of the legal system pertaining to humanitarian and social protection system. In particular, the review presents results of exploration of existing national legislation and concrete recommendations in regard the amendments required for the social protection system to be able to scale up cash assistance as part of a national humanitarian response. A validation workshop has been conducted in participation of key stakeholders to present preliminary findings and recommendations of above two assessments as well as to collect feedbacks of national partners in regard prioritising the further steps based on feasibility and importance.(3)  Training Workshop on Scaling Up Emergency Cash Transfers in Response to Emergency Situations has been conducted for government counterparts in Uzbekistan during the period of 17-19 July 2023. More than 25 key staff representing 16 ministries and agencies, responsible for humanitarian response in case of emergency situations participated in 3-day training. The training was adapted to local context and was articulated around a series of applied thematic sessions, which exposed participants to practical operational issues when designing and delivering emergency cash transfers through the national social protection system in response to emergencies. (4)  Initial assessment of the role of cash transfers and other social protection responses to climate-induced heatwaves has been conducted, considering that it is one of the biggest hazards in Uzbekistan. According to UNICEF’s Children Climate Risk Index, 9.6 million children under 18 are exposed to heatwaves in Uzbekistan or 91% of the children. In the context of climate change, the severity, duration, and intensity of these events are expected to increase, impacting the lives and livelihoods of millions of children and their families. Yet, globally, the linkages between shock-responsive social protection, including using cash transfers as a response mechanism, are under-researched. In this regard, data collection has been conducted, which was followed by a rapid literature review and development of a report looking at the potential role of cash transfers in response to climate-induced heat waves and recommendations on the ways forward.

The Youth Centers conducted a digital story telling activity with the aim to develop the participants' capacity on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and gender based violence (GBV), as well as building their skills on script writing and storytelling. At the end of the training, the participants came out with the scripts to be converted into short animation movies, conveying messages on SRH and GBV, to create awareness among their peers. As a result, the participants created 4 scripts to be crafted as short animations, with the following subjects: gender-based violence, peer bullying, sexually transmitted infections and family planning methods. The animations were broadcasted in the Project’s website (https://www.gencmulteciler.org/en/english/) and social media accounts, and were disseminated through telephone networks such as Whatsapp, reaching out to the beneficiaries.""

Methodological materials covering career orientation for children with disabilities and recommendations on how to conduct flexible assessments of student’s knowledge and skills were developed.UNICEF in partnership with the Republican Institute of Professional Education and the Belarus State Pedagogical University updated educational standards, curricula, and pre-service training programmes for student teachers. Becoming a mandatory training for all student teachers from September 2023, these programmes will ensure that all future educators are equipped with knowledge and skills for inclusive teaching. Two new methodologies on inclusive education practices will be integrated into curricula for special education students, who are being trained for work in resource centers for inclusive education, psycho-medico-pedagogical commissions, and early complex assistance services. The Academy of Post Graduate Education (APE) introduced training programmes including an online course on inclusive education into their in-service curriculum in 2023-2024 and tested them with educators and practitioners.One hundred eighteen (118) schools and kindergartens from all over Belarus were selected for piloting new curricula, educational standards and support system of the network of inclusive education resource centers. A needs assessment in each school and kindergarten for assistive devices and technologies for children with special education needs was conducted. UNICEF started procurement of required assistive equipment to be completed in 2024.Three study tours to Russia to learn best inclusive education practices for representatives of the MOE (including Deputy Minister of Education), National Institute of Education (NIO), Republican Institute of Professional Education, Academy of Post Graduate Education, Belarus State Pedagogical University, Deputy Heads of Oblast Education Departments, and school and pre-school directors were conducted.","1206721","1043090","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Following UNHCR's advocacy efforts, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Innovation agreed to propose an amendment to the Law on Recognition of Foreign Diplomas and Qualifications. This amendment acknowledges that refugees cannot always obtain all the documents necessary for the recognition of foreign diplomas as required by regular procedures. The new provision will ensure that the rejection of an application for the recognition of foreign educational documents and qualifications cannot be based solely on the absence of official documents proving a certain foreign professional qualification. This change aligns with the Law on International and Temporary Protection of Foreigners. The adoption of these legal changes is expected in 2025.
Consequently, the Ministry of Education has started collaborating with the Council of Europe to determine the manner of establishing qualifications and skills for refugees who do not possess the respective educational certificates (prior test). UNHCR will continue to make significant effort to contribute to the adoption of this procedure.

At the meetings, parents and children spend time together, participate in creative workshops, communicate with other families. UNICEF supported ukrainian NGO Dobro Djelo to organize workshops with clinical psychologist, cognitive-behavioural therapist and trauma expert where children and caregivers were provided with mental health and psychosocial support. In the reporting period, 389 children and caregivers have benefited from these activities. In cooperation with several women NGOs, 214 women, girls and boys were provided information on how to access GBV risk mitigation, prevention and/or response interventions. 13 most vulnerable children have continued to received individual case management from Red Cross and other NGOs specialized staff. As part of the UNICEF and Ministry Education programme, supportive Ukrainian speaking staff in the schools with the most refugee children are engaged and trained to support children in learning. Learning material on the Digital Scholl platform translated in Ukrainian language and prepared to be shared with refugee children and families. Psychosocial support was provided to 186 children through implementing group workshops based on the standardized package ‘’Empower yourself” while individual sessions were provided to 6 children. Furniture and IT equipment was procured for 6 primary schools and 4 preschools to support enrollment and quality conditions for children from Ukraine. Through the creation of a web service between the databases of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, to enable the identification of children who are in Montenegro, are of school age but are not enrolled the system is identifying the refugee out-of-school children (OOSC).  A total of 505 Ukrainian children currently enrolled in formal education system are benefiting from the set of activities implemented by the Ministry of Education with UNICEF support. Classrooms open to children from foreign countries | UNICEF UNICEF supported Ukrainian NGO Dobro Djelo to organize non-formal education support, including early learning (Montessori educational group for children; art classes; music classes, Ukrainian Saturday school for first grades students;) with additional 113 children benefiting from non-formal learning support and provided with learning materials. UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health is supporting 5 PHCs in the 5 cities where the vast majority of the refugees live. Thus far the PHCs organized training for all PHC on health services and entitlements for the refugees and piloted breastfeeding counselling centres in the 5 municipalities. The PHCs have also produced and disseminated information material for parents on the Montenegrin immunization calendar, breastfeeding and breastfeeding counselling centres, and on the Bebbo mobile app for parents. The PHCs have also introduced an online feedback mechanism for refugees using the UNICEF data collection platform InForm.  776 refugees were supported and provided with primary health services with UNICEF support to the Ministry of Health and 5 primary health centers focusing on the following priorities: Strengthen the knowledge and communication skills of healthcare workers for working with refugees. Facilitate the communication of refugees with the health system Facilitate the access of refugees to health care, with a special emphasis on the care of mothers, babies and small children. Facilitate the identification and overcoming of possible difficulties that may arise when refuges are accessing health care through mechanisms for providing feedback in Ukrainian and Russian languages.  Through support coming from UNICEF, Institute for public health of Montenegro has intensified work on strengthening HIV/AIDS testing services on primary health care level as well as treatment and clinical management on secondary and tertiary level of health care. At the same Institute for public health has distributed around 700 rapid tests for anti-HIV 1/2 antibodies, HBsAg tests and anti-HCV antibody tests.  27 mothers from Ukraine were supported with breastfeeding and young children and infant nutrition counseling in the primary health centeres.  With UNICEF support, Ukrainian NGO Dobro djelo organized 2 educational groups held by specialist staff for pregnant women and parents of newborn babies. With UNICEF support, primary health centers in 5 municipalities have introduced an online feedback mechanism for refugees using the UNICEF data collection platform InForm. Through this service refugees have the opportunity to provide feedback and complaint on the health services and based on that the institutions should plan follow-up actions.  UNICEF supported the Ukrainan women NGO Dobro Djelo to establish a helpline for feedback and complaints, sharing concerns and asking questions benefiting 64 people in the reporting period (in total 695) out of which close to 80 % were women. The cooperation with NGO Dobro Djelo, enabled UNICEF to be in direct contact with the affected population with focus on women and children which contributed to a more inclusive overall refugee response.  UNICEF supported ukrainian NGO Dobro Djelo to organize non-formal education support and inclusion activities such as : course on sexual education; chess classes, basketball trainings for children; tennis group trainings, Christmas event (500 guests); music concert;)  Since both gender-based violence and human trafficking are forms of violence, in which the perpetrators use a series of manipulation techniques, the victims themselves are often not even aware that they are victims. That is why, the UNICEF supported NGO Womens Right Center designed the brochure ""There is a Way Out"", which provides knowledge about these issues. The brochure has been translated into Ukrainian, Russian and English, which makes it accessible to a large number of migrant and refugee women. The brochure was printed in 1050 copies and distributed to the final target group through the departments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Budva and Podgorica that work directly with migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.

During the period 2024–2025, the focus will be on strengthening the capacity of teachers delivering the Decisions for a Healthy Lifestyle course across all VET institutions by accrediting the continuous training program. Additionally, efforts will be made to equip schools with edutainment materials and menstrual hygiene products, as well as create a youth friendly learning classroom in 20 targeted VET institutions endowed with IT equipment.

Furthermore, support will be provided to strengthen the Peer Educators Network in promoting life skills education and increase capacity of business companies from dual VET in creating a youth-friendly workplace. A dedicated training program will also be organized for nurses, psychologists, and social pedagogues working within VET institutions to enhance their ability to support students' well-being.
A parenting program will be developed and implemented to engage parents of VET students in supporting their children's education and development. At the same time, Youth Centers will receive support in designing and implementing career guidance and employability skills programs, ensuring that young people are better prepared for their transition into the labor market.

To address this gap, UNDP developed methodology for analysis of demand and supply of skilled labor force for planning of annual enrollments at Technical and Vocational Training Institutes. To ensure the vocational education system equips students with in-demand skillset, UNDP completed development/revision of state competency-based education standards with corresponding modular programs for a number of occupations in high demand. To enhance the capacities of local vocational institutions for delivering modern curricula, UNDP equipped 10 of them with IT, sewing and greenhouse production equipment, benefiting 2,537 students (women 1,395, men 1,142), and strengthened the capacities of 620 teaching staff (women 434, men 186).

Most preschool organizations are public (57%), but the number of private preschool organizations has drastically increased during the last decade (NEDB, 2021-2022). The newly adopted government Concept of Education Development for 2022-2026 focuses on pre-schools. All pre-school organizations will introduce international tools of quality assessment of upbringing and education. Parents will be able to choose a place in any preschool organization, on the principle of per capita financing. However, the gaps in capacity of pre-schools in planning and monitoring of quality remain. The Ministry of Enlightenment (MoE) has established a new Pre-school education department. At the World ECCE conference, Kazakhstan among other countries adopted the ‘Tashkent Declaration and Commitments to Action for Transforming Early Childhood Care and Education.’ The Declaration seeks to renew and strengthen political commitments and action toward ECCE from birth to 8 years of age. In 2022 UNICEF continued introducing new components into the quality assurance system of public and private pre-schools like self-assessment tools, a set of indicators, score card, capacity development of 351 kindergartens in planning and monitoring. Ultimately, this new methodology will result in an available baseline data on ECCE, improved Education Management Information System (EMIS) with ECE indicators, certification and accreditation of service providers, and advancing decision making around such dimensions like pedagogy, time for play, child’s interactions with space and materials, interactions between children, interactions among staff and parents/family engagement.

During the second quarter of 2022, the MoUs with four national medical universities were signed. Karagandy, West Kazakhstan, Semey, and Kazakh National medical universities exist. On 16-31 May 2022, 107 faculty staff members of four medical universities attended distance-based training on family planning and modern contraceptives at srh.org.kz. 100 out of 107 (93%) completed the course and obtain the certificate.","91000","91000","91000","To enhance the institutional mechanisms to deliver comprehensive SRH services and information with a focus on the furthest behind, the UNFPA CO focused on promoting international norms and standards in the medical education system. To achieve this goal, the UNFPA CO started work in 2022 simultaneously in 2 directions: (i) establishing partnerships with 4 leading medical universities in the country (Karagandy Medical University; Semey Medical University; Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, and West Kazakhstan Medical University), covering 80% of all medical students in the country, and (ii) developing new curricula corresponding to the UNFPA mandate.As a result, the 60-hours training curriculum on “Quality assurance of the inpatient perinatal care” developed in 2021 with UNFPA support was approved by the National Academic Council and recommended for roll-out in all medical universities in the country. As the first step of the curriculum's roll-out implementation, 25 faculty staff from national medical universities strengthened their capacity with UNFPA support in 2022 during an initial 8 days' combined training (5 days online via the Moodle platform and 3 days face-to-face held on 29 August to 7 September in Astana.To further align Kazakhstan's medical education with international standards, the UNFPA CO helped to develop in 2022 training curricula on “Effective Antenatal Care” and ""Clinical management of uncomplicated and complicated labor and birth at the hospital level"" and facilitated their piloting via digital platform edu-open.kz. Both courses were submitted to the National Academic Council under the MoH for approval and inclusion into the postgraduate medical education. Throughout its support UNFPA facilitated the use of information technologies as an innovative way to strengthen capacity not only via in-person training but also via specially designed training platforms solutions1) The ""SRH.ORG.KZ"" distance-based training platform on Family Planning and modern contraceptive methods, developed in 2020 by the CO was approved on 27 May 2022 by the National Academic council under the MoH and recommended for roll-out among professional society. The roll-out of the platform in 2022 was started by training of 182 medical universities’ and nurses colleges faculty members, and 120 PHCs health professionals.2) The “EDU-OPEN.KZ” digital solution specially designed by the CO in 2021 based on the Moodle platform. This website is used for all training provided by the CO in 2022 more than 250 trainees used this as a tool for homeworks and remote learning.3) Learning short videos. For the curriculum on ""Clinical management of uncomplicated and complicated labor and birth at the hospital level"" three learning short videos developed on “Using Labor Partogram,”; “Emergency care algorithm for severe obstetric hemorrhage,”; “The labor care algorithm for obstetric-gynecologists and midwives”. ","113000","113000","113000","UNFPA focused on the promotion of international standards and recommendations on SRHR in the national medical education system. UNFPA supported organizing the First Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. During the Congress, UNFPA presented to the academic society five curricula on family planning and modern contraception, antenatal care, effective perinatal care, quality assurance in maternities, and CEMD (Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths), which were developed with UNFPA support in 2021-2022. Furthermore, the Republican Academic Council on 20 September 2023 approved postgraduate curricula developed with UNFPA support on (i) Guiding Principles of Antenatal Care, and (ii) Guiding Principles to Manage Physiological and Complicated Labour and Birth. To roll out both curricula among national medical universities, UNFPA conducted two workshops which covered 65 faculty staff members and leading health professionals from 7 medical universities and all 20 regions of the country.","50000","50000","50000","The CO works on integrating the SRHR international standards into the national medical education curricula.

In 2023 UNFPA will continue implementing the out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) program. This initiative will follow UNFPA’s International Technical and Programmatic Guidance on Out-of-School CSE and will focus on reaching adolescents and young people in rural areas, those with disabilities, and youth from the left bank of the Nistru River.
In 2024, the initiative aims to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment where all young people, regardless of their background, have access to comprehensive sexuality education and essential resources for a healthy and informed future. To achieve this, several institutions and organizations working with youth will be equipped with dedicated spaces for non-formal sexuality education activities.
Additionally, civil society organizations, particularly those in underserved regions, will receive support to enhance their capacity in promoting young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. Specialists from various organizations will be trained to deliver accurate, age-appropriate education on these topics, ensuring that young people are well-informed and empowered.
Furthermore, parents and caregivers of adolescents with disabilities will be provided with the necessary knowledge and resources to support their children’s development and smooth transition into adulthood.
In 2025, UNFPA will continue strengthening civil society organizations and youth networks across Moldova, including those on the left bank of the Nistru River, to develop and implement programs on sexual and reproductive health and rights tailored to diverse youth groups. To support these efforts, UNFPA will create guidelines for delivering youth-friendly health services for vulnerable youth, aligned with international out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education (OOS CSE) standards.
A digital training program will be introduced for facilitators working in CSE, ensuring they are well-equipped to provide accurate and effective education. Additionally, new educational and interactive materials, such as the Diary of an Adolescent Boy/Girl, will be developed to make information on sexual and reproductive health and rights more accessible and relevant to young people. 
Building on UNFPA Moldova’s expertise in youth well-being and global best practices, and in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) and the Youth National Agency, UNFPA will establish the Future-Ready Hub—a pioneering space dedicated to life skills development, innovation, and modern technologies.

In response to the Ukraine crisis and continued irregular migrant crisis, UNICF continued to provide GBV and child safeguarding training and outreach for partners.Through experiences from the migrant and refugee crises, UNICEF strengthened protection mechanisms for unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC) jointly with UNHCR and IOM, advocating with the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Department of Citizenship and Migration and the Ministry of Education for development an interagency algorithm for UASC, adding best interests determination (BID) and case management to early intervention measures. In collaboration with UNHCR, UNICEF conducted BID with four vulnerable UASCs from places such as Yemen and Liberia.

In this context, five thematic studies, as well as “Education Sector Review in Armenia” have been initiated on general education (including pre-primary level) and will be completed in 2022. The ESPDG process triggered a transparent policy dialogue between the MoESCS, developmental partners and key education stakeholders, and will influence the upcoming national education sector strategy. 
In close collaboration and discussions with MoESCS and NCET, the e-module on the assessment and registration of preschool and school-age children with special education needs (SEN) was tested. It is planned to have a separate Module within the Educational Management Information System (EMIS), to be used for coordination and evaluation of the services, and for information exchange with the health and social protection sectors. The finalization of the e-system, including the development of the submodules on SEN assessment, service provision and education progress of children, including CWD, as well as piloting are planned for 2022.","635039","635039","635039","The State Education Development Programme of the Republic of Armenia until 2030 was approved by the Parliament in September 2022. As a result of UNICEF support, the document is equipped with a solid evidence base that informed key decisions and directions within the Programme; it enjoys good consensus among actors of the education sector and beyond; and it will be accompanied by a costed action plan to ensure effective implementation.  Comprehensive education sector assessments and reviews are not a common practice in Armenia. Usually, education system’s analytical work is fragmented and scattered in different documents. With UNICEF support and continued partnership, MoESCS finalised and released five thematic studies and the Education Sector Review report, a comprehensive evidence base used to inform reform efforts. The process was highly participatory and aimed at establishing a systematic approach for education sector analysis, enhancing the quality of education sector plans, budgeting as well as to ensure regular joint education sector reviews. The various components of the plan are consistent between them and with government-wide strategies and international commitments, including the pledge made by the Government of Armenia at the Transforming Education Summit this year. The Government is likely to face challenges in mobilizing sufficient financing to implement the strategy. Implementation and monitoring a large number of activities and indicators is another challenge. The costed action plan under preparation with UNICEF support is expected to mitigate those risks and improve operationalization.There is a persistent teacher shortage, especially in rural and remote communities, and the shortage is likely to become even more acute in the nearest future. The Education Sector Plan notes that 46% of teachers are over 50 and only 11% under 30. According to 2022 university admission results, few young people selected teaching as a profession. Thus, replacement of retiring teachers is a concern that MESCS is addressing by scaling up a new incentive scheme through which teachers can earn higher salaries if they successfully engage in a voluntary certification process based on new professional standards. This provision is based on the recommendations of the UNICEF-supported study on teacher deployment whose findings were discussed with the ministry. The National Center for Education Technologies through E-School Armenia scaled up the online mentor school model for online teaching and learning earlier developed with UNICEF support. The initiative allowed to identify and use the potential of highly qualified teachers and schools.In response to children’s needs arising from recurrent escalations along the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan and other tensions of geo-political nature, special attention was given to education continuity in safe and enabling environments. In five schools and three kindergartens in Syunik region, UNICEF and partners provided healthy lifestyles and hygiene education, and repaired WASH facilities ensuring gender and disability aspects are duly considered. Eight schools received new school furniture and UNICEF learning and recreation kits. Children from Nagorno Karabakh stranded in Armenia due to the Lachin corridor blockage received school bags and stationery to support their temporary placement in schools in Armenia.","300408","300408","300408","UNICEF continued its collaboration with MoESCS and partners around the ongoing education reforms becoming a partner of choice in the education sector. UNICEF contributed to policy dialogue by supporting national consultations for the 2023-2026 Action Plan (AP) adjacent to the State Program for Development of Education until 2030 (EDP), which was adopted in late 2022 with UNICEF support. The AP defines clear targets, and timeframes for implementation and was approved in March. The European Union chose UNICEF to act as technical assistance agency for the implementation of the EU Budget Support, which covers a significant part of the budget required for the education sector reforms until 2026. UNICEF initiated the Education Joint Sector Review for the first time in years, which will contribute to improving the monitoring and accountability functions. UNICEF produced an Education Budget Brief and conducted the Education Sector Plan Appraisal that provided key recommendations that informed and influenced various reform decisions with consideration of gender and disability. System capacity, including the capacity to effectively monitor the ESP implementation and coordination are recognized as critical issues by both reports. The reports also highlight the importance of investing in datasystems for better planning and implementation of education programs. They recommend investing in EMIS to enhance scope and coherence of data collection between education levels and to enhance disaggregation by disability, gender, age, and other parameters. Partly because of this and previously generated evidence, MoESCS recently introduced a new management model of public educational institutions separating educational and administrative-economic processes, an approach that should lead to a clearer distribution of duties and responsibilities. A new funding formula for public education institutions was initiated and will be implemented in 2024. UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry and CSO partners contributed to strengthening the teacher professional development system, which this year has involved an increased number of teachers in voluntary teacher certification. In 2023, certification was held in all subjects, and those who do not work anywhere, but have a pedagogical education, were allowed to participate. This move was coherent with the recommendations of the UNICEF 2022 analytical report that advises reconsidering the standards and the content of voluntary certification making it attractive to more teachers. UNICEF supported teachers’ forums and conferences contributing to professional development opportunities, sharing best practices, and promoting pedagogical innovations. ","428000","396150","396150","The MoESCS sustained education reforms despite the significant challenges and uncertainties that Armenia and the wider region have faced in recent years. 2024 was an important milestone as the country reached the midpoint of the Education State Programme's 2023-2026 Action Plan (AP). In this framework, UNICEF’s analytical work, high level technical assistance, field-level engagement, and capacity development initiatives have comprehensively contributed to advancing education reforms.Under the budget support agreement between Armenia and the European Union (EU), UNICEF provided technical assistance to the MoESCS to enhance quality and equity of education services, through improved coordination, monitoring and enhancement of professional competences. UNICEF in collaboration with the MoESCS initiated a joint sector review (JSR) of the education sector to discuss the progress of the reforms in January 2024. This review aimed to discuss the progress of reforms and its findings were presented to development partners and education stakeholders during the first high-level policy dialogue held in Armenia under the EU's budget support agreement with UNICEF technical inputs, a newly established platform of regular policy dialogues that contributes to greater accountability and joint monitoring of the situation in the education sector. Subsequently, these discussions informed a revision of the key targets in the 2023-2026 Action Plan at the end of the year. Overall, it was noted that while Armenia has made significant progress in enhancing educational content, improving professional competencies, changing teaching methods, student assessment and evaluation approaches, and creating child-friendly learning environments through initiatives like the ""300 Schools and 500 Kindergartens"" programme. At the same time, there are also challenges that require further attention. Some of those issues are related to refugee children from Nagorno-Karabakh, integration of out-of-school children, enhancement of educational leadership, and early childhood education.In response to the refugee influx from Nagorno Karabakh, UNICEF continued to support the MoESCS in accommodating and effectively including refugee children in Armenia’s education system, focusing on areas where the system has been mostly overstretched by the additional number of students. In order to expand learning spaces in schools with high concentration of refugee children together with children from host communities, 65 classrooms in 22 schools from Kotayk, Vayots Dzor, Ararat, Armavir and Gegharkunik regions were provided with school furniture and educational supplies. 5,155 children have received learning materials, including school bags with stationery. 8,072 refugee children have accessed remedial education and MHPSS services. In order to address psycho-social needs of refugee and other vulnerable children, UNICEF in collaboration with UNESCO initiated a partnership with the Republican Pedagogical-Psychological Support Center (RPPC) to enhance Mental Health and Psychological Service (MHPSS) in schools focusing on social-emotional learning, psycho-social resilience building, and creating a safe environment for children to learn and thrive. A training program on MHPSS in schools and a manual for building psychosocial resilience in children was developed and piloted. This resource helps educational staff create a supportive learning environment. As a result, 690 school psychologists and 362 teachers improved their skills in providing effective MHPSS services to children.","420285","420284","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

To operationalize the implementation of the Law on Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted in 2021, major legislative reforms are ongoing for alignment of sectoral policy frameworks with UN CRPD. Several policy papers were also developed based on the fundamental principles of the Convention such as the social model of disability, the procedures for reasonable accommodation in educational institutions, revision of the funding formula for inclusive education and minimum standards for physical accessibility of all preschool and general educational institutions. This process is supported by UNICEF in collaboration with other UN agencies, to enable the transition to the new disability assessment, certification, and to initiate a service delivery nationwide pilot in 2023. With UNICEF technical assistance, MoLSA developed several regulatory acts to operationalize the legal framework for the reform of Disability Assessment System and introduce the Functional Assessment of Disability taking into due consideration child-related aspects. Specific interventions include the revision of the disability assessment/certification and individual service provision planning procedures, updating the list of Assistive Technology (AT) addressing the needs of children throughout their lives and across settings such as home, school, and community. A set of assessment tools for 4 age groups and 7 types of special educational needs (SEN) assessment were developed and piloted among preschool/school age children with the purpose to make the SEN assessment more measurable, accurate, and informative. The new Individual Educational Plan (IEP) was tested for both preschools and schools and proved to be more user-friendly. With UNICEF support, MESCS modelled the Special School for children with hearing impairments as a Resource Center. Progress was also made in enhancing operational features of e-disability and the SEN module of the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in order to enhance data collection on children with disabilities and their participation in school. As a result of UNICEF policy advocacy, an action plan aimed at enhancing the quality and accessibility of inclusive education services as well as ensuring inclusion starting from early year at preschool level was adopted by the Government. Through partnership with the Republican Pedagogical and Psychological Support Center (RPPC), the pedagogical-psychological support system for children with special educational needs and children with disabilities was strengthened.Along with the reforms, cooperation and partnership with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs), NGOs and international organizations was prioritized by the Government and resulted in more participatory processes and consultations for developing inclusive strategic papers and projects for persons with disabilities. The current joint efforts of UN agencies with the government, OPDs and international partners bring a fresh perspective for successful evolvement of the current reforms.","550000","532459","532459","2023 saw significant efforts to operationalize the National Disability System reform. Sectoral policy frameworks were aligned with the UNCRPD aiming to shift perceptions towards persons with disabilities (PwD) and provide the Government with clear strategies to operationalize community-based services, including for children with disabilities (CwD). The pilot phase of the Personal Assistant model was initiated engaging children with disabilities. UNICEF also contributed to the strengthening the new disability assessment and certification scheme, by costing the setup of one testing unit in the Unified Social Service USS) and equipping it with assistive devices, by building the capacity of multidisciplinary assessment teams (including health, social and education/developmental professionals) and by contributing to the development of an e-disability information system. UNICEF also provided technical support in generating country-specific evidence on ecosystem to support access to assistive technologies as well as on assessment of child disability. Both aim at supporting policy development to enhance functioning, participation in learning and social inclusion of children with disabilities from early years through adulthood. UNICEF in collaboration with UNDP and UNFPA continued to promote adherence to UNCRPD principles and the advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities. UN agencies stimulated the engagement of persons with disabilities in national development mechanisms and supported the enhancement of the capacity of Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPD). UNICEF’s cooperation with OPDs promoting the rights of children with disabilities and underrepresented groups resulted in the establishment of a platform for regular consultations on disability issues and validation of legal and policy reform documents, and disability service models. UNICEF conducted a capacity needs mapping among OPDs. Based on its findings, a series of awareness-raising campaigns were organized with OPDs, NGOs, and line ministries on Disability System Reform, UNCRPD, CEDAW, Universal Design, and reasonable accommodations. The CO continued its partnership with the Republican Pedagogical and Psychological Support Center in strengthening the pedagogical-psychological support system for children with special educational needs, including hearing impairments. The revised toolkit for Special Educational Needs assessment (SEN) was applied in secondary schools making the assessment process more participatory, accurate, and informative. UNICEF and its partners introduced three innovative service provision models, including: the first Armenian language augmentative and alternative communication application for tablets offered free of charge in App Store and Play market; “Internet of Things” that aimed to create opportunities for 14–18-year-old adolescents with and without disabilities to identify and develop smart solutions to issues that concern them; the Special Equipment library for children with disabilities, with a lending option of therapeutic equipment and positioning devices necessary to ensure their uninterrupted rehabilitation therapies at home.","460000","361476","361476","In 2024, UNICEF continued supporting the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA) in enhancing the realization of disability rights for children in Armenia, contributing to the operationalization of the National Disability System Reform in line with the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The Government approved several sectoral legal documents that were developed through UNICEF technical assistance, including amendments to the regulation on the provision of Personal Assistant Services and the amendments in the Regulation of Day Care Centers. These provisions will enable children with disabilities to receive tailored support that helps them function optimally in daily life, enhancing their ability to participate in educational and social activities. In addition, progress was made in the policy dialogue related to disability-inclusive social protection and services, a topic that was discussed at the two-day international conference titled ""Towards a World without Barriers: Accelerating Implementation of Disability Inclusive Social Protection"" organized in Yerevan by MLSA in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, GIZ, UNDP, UNICEF, and UNFPA. The conference reviewed progress and addressed ongoing challenges related to disability-inclusive social protection and services in the region and globally.The CO continued its partnership with the Republican Pedagogical and Psychological Support Center (RPPC) in strengthening the pedagogical-psychological support system for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The focus was on enhancing SEN assessment, service provision and monitoring. The CO invested in ongoing teacher training through introduction of the Interpersonal Communication and Community Engagement to Support Inclusion training package. Trainings for trainers were conducted in all regions of Armenia for 244 specialists (242 women, 2 men) from 12 regional pedagogical psychological support centers.The MoESCS approved an action plan and schedule for reorganization of the special general education institutions (https://www.arlis.am/documentview.aspx?docid=192158). This is an important milestone towards a more operational environment for including children with disabilities and with special educational needs in mainstream educational institutions. UNICEF provided technical assistance for the development of the resource center charter and for piloting the transition from special school to mainstream school with a group of 15 students with hearing impairments. The Resource Center for Children with Hearing Impairments will officially start operating in September 2025. UNICEF supported the development and publication of 6 methodological manuals aimed at increasing the efficiency of inclusive education and improving professional skills of pedagogical workers involved in this process. The CO provided didactic materials to 25 regional chapters of RPPC, including bags with assessment tools for mobile teams to provide services to students in educational institutions within their catchment area.In 2024, UNICEF delivered targeted disability inclusion activities as part of the refugee response in partnership with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPD), including SOURCE Foundation, “Havat” NGO of Hard of Hearing Children’s Mothers and Lady Cox Rehabilitation Center, the latter being a refugee-run OPD that UNICEF supported also in adjusting to Armenia’s operational environment. More than 300 refugee children with multiple disabilities received needs-based and specialized support, developmental and rehabilitation services, MHPSS, assistive technologies, and humanitarian assistance.Awareness-raising activities included producing video reels on topics related to children with hearing impairments, validating best practices and lessons learned from two assistive technology models, and organizing a two-day workshop on ""Access to Services for Persons with Disabilities."" Parents of CwD, practitioners, policy makers and NGO/OPD representatives got an opportunity to learn about innovative practices in the country, remaining challenges in service provision and voice their suggestions.","105000","1804","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

UNICEF in close collaboration with MoESCS and MOTADI, identified the target communities for establishment of early learning services in 2022-2023, guided by the provisions of the Law on Preschool Education and the 2021 Action Plan on Implementation of Inclusive Preschool services. As of December 2021, 15 communities have initiated renovation works, 3 of them have already finished, the rest will finish in the 1st quarter of 2022. It is expected that, overall, 289 children in rural underserved communities will gain access to preschool education services. 
UNICEF continued advancing early identification and intervention practices. Specifically, the training module and practical guide on “Basics of Early Identification and Intervention” for doctors and nurses was tested in Amasia health center and was accredited by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia. Several legal documents were developed/finalized to enable the provision of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services for children, including the Follow up Growth Charts for children with cerebral palsy to be used by primary health care workers; the follow up of neonates with developmental risk factors; antenatal screening of Alpha-fetoprotein. Finally, the early identification of developmental delays/ disabilities and intervention policy framework has been revised. Early identification of children with developmental delays is critical in the early stages to facilitate early intervention for maximizing the developmental potential of children, and improving outcomes for children, families, and communities.
The provisions of the Law on Pre-school Education started to be implemented in 2021. Specifically, 2021-2023 Action plan for making all preschools inclusive was adopted, state budget was allocated for establishment of alternative pre-school services. The draft of preschool education standards was developed and are at the final stage of public review. The Government program for 2021-2026 targets establishment or renovation of at least 500 kindergartens and preschools by 2026, ensuring furnishing and equipment.
UNICEF Armenia provided technical assistance to selected communities in defining the terms of reference and recruiting the educators for the preschool services, training and mentoring of selected educators for 15 early learning centers and building the capacity of the staff of reference kindergartens to further support the newly established alternative preschool services and provide them with methodological guidance thus ensuring the sustainability of the initiative.","880000","851348","851348","With UNICEF continued support, the policy framework, infrastructure and technical capacities of service providers continued to be strengthened to ensure all young children have access to quality and inclusive preschool. The enrolment of children in preschool institutions (public and private) during 2021-2022 school year increased (32.3%) in comparison with the 2020-2021 year (24.3%). This can be considered an indication of positive trends also due to continued efforts to invest and prioritize early childhood education, although enrolment rates still remain lower compared with the pre-COVID situation (34.7%) and inequities between rural and urban areas remain. Despite some improvement in enrolment rates including in rural areas, the limited number of preschools remains a key bottleneck with children in approximately 200 rural settlements missing the opportunity for early learning due to the absence of pre-school services.  Hence enlargement of the network of preschools remained a priority in the 2021-2026 Government Programme and the new ESP. In this context, as a result of the tripartite collaboration between UNICEF, MoESCS and MOTAI, 256 children (out of them 130 girls) 3-6 years old benefited from 15 operating alternative early learning centers in rural settlements, and around 400 parents learnt about holistic child development and upbringing. Young women from those rural communities were trained to work as teachers, which contributed to establish sustainable solutions for the functioning of the preschools, besides contributing to their income and empowerment. During renovation access to clean water, and energy efficient measures were considered. The preschool buildings were equipped with solar photovoltaic system to ensure access to renewable energy systems. Outdoor playgrounds were established close to the early learning centers to ensure outdoor activities of children. Simultaneously, another 10 rural settlements were supported by the state-budget to establish alternative preschool education services. The training module and practical guide on “Basics of Early Identification and Intervention” for primary health care staff were included in the List of accredited training for in-services continuous professional development. The Concept on Early childhood intervention and rehabilitation services for children was developed with UNICEF support and is awaiting approval by line ministries (MoESCS, MoLSA and MoTAI). Subsequently, they will become the basis for the development of the Action plan for strengthening early identification of developmental delays and disabilities, early intervention and follow up. Early identification of children with developmental delays is critical in the early stages to facilitate early intervention for maximizing the developmental potential of children, and improving outcomes for children, families, and communities.  ","900000","628828","628828","UNICEF continued to advocate and provide technical assistance for strengthening policy frameworks, infrastructure, service providers’ technical capacities, and data systems to ultimately ensure all young children have access to quality inclusive preschool. The number of preschool facilities, including nursery-kindergartens and pre-primary classrooms in schools, grew by 10%. The enrolment of children 0-6 age group in preschools increased to 36% during the 2022-2023 academic year compared to 32.3% in 2021-2022. This can be attributed to continued efforts, also supported by UNICEF, to invest and prioritize early childhood education. Preschool network expansion remains a top focus in the ESP. In this regard, UNICEF, MESCS, and MTAI continue close collaboration. In 2023, UNICEF increased the number of alternative preschools in remote settlements to 40 by establishing 9 new facilities. The expansion of the network of the alternative preschools contributed to the gender equality in the country by empowering particularly women caregivers to get engaged in income generation and community life thus increasing the use of the full talent pool of the population and to enhancing women’s economic independence. 518 children 3-6 age group (45% girls, 55% boys) in remote settlements benefitted, and 600 parents learned about holistic child development. State funding was provided for the establishment of alternative preschools in 3 more rural settlements. Access to, gender-sensitive WASH facilities, energy efficiency, and climate resilience measures were considered throughout the refurbishment process, including installation of photovoltaic systems. To ensure outdoor learning activities, playgrounds were established near alternative preschools. 80 young women from rural settlements were trained to become preschool educators. 2,134 children (45% girls, 55% boys) in 23 state kindergartens functioning as resource hubs for alternative preschools benefitted from additionally capacitated staff and improved furnishing.Financial mechanisms to enhance mainstreaming inclusion at preschool level have been introduced nationwide. Furthermore, several provisions were approved to set standards and better regulate the provision of services, including the preschool education program for each age group, regulations on selection of preschool educators, mandatory in-service training requirements and the list of required furniture and equipment. A two-day national conference on preschool education was held with UNICEF support, involving 300 teachers, administrators, academics and other practitioners, who learnt about new regulations and developments and discussed the way forward. This first ever experience of this kind has the potential to create a platform that brings together different experiences and enables greater ownership over the ongoing reforms among practitioners. Despite significant improvement in preschool enrolment rates, the lack of preschools continues to be a major bottleneck and became more evident with the arrival of refugees in September.  In this context, through a collaboration between UNICEF, MESCS and local authorities, a mapping exercise of preschool facilities in areas of high concentration of refugees was initiated to identify priority communities where facilities and services need to be expanded. UNICEF also initiated a partnership to expand the capacity of early learning services by establishing 20 fully equipped preschool classrooms. To strengthen the system’s capacity to early identify children with disabilities or special educational needs and include them in preschool from the beginning 325 primary health care doctors and nurses (97% women) accomplished accredited Training on “Child development and early identification”. Child development assessment kit was developed and distributed with Posters “Red flags Early identification guide” to iPHC sites covering 13% of 0-5 children population.","845000","754445","754445","UNICEF continued to support the operationalization of the Law on Preschool Education, enhancing policy frameworks and service providers' capacity to provide quality inclusive preschool services. Despite advancements in the enrollment rates for children 3 to 5 years old, enrolment for children below 3 remains extremely low at 4% and policy dialogue between UNICEF and MoESCS led to the important decision of piloting new mechanisms to expand coverage.Despite improvements in enrollment rates, the limited number of preschools remains a key bottleneck contributing to inequities between rural and urban areas (46% urban, 24% rural). A differentiated approach was taken to address the lack of preschool education in around 200 rural settlements, with tailored solutions.The enlargement of the preschool network has remained a priority in the 2021-2026 Government Programme. In this context, as a result of close collaboration between UNICEF, MoESCS, MOTAI, and local self-government bodies, 5,685 children (47% girls, 4% refugees) aged 2-5 benefited from the services of 50 kindergartens and 37 alternative preschool education facilities refurbished and equipped with soft furniture and didactic/learning materials.Through parental education sessions, around 400 parents learnt about nurturing care, holistic child development, caregiver-child positive interaction, importance of early learning, healthy nutrition, and pediatric diseases.Investment in preschool staff capacity development remained a key priority, featuring enhanced training and more structured communication. The MoESCS and UNICEF organized the second National Conference on Preschool Education, offering a valuable and ongoing strategic forum for 600 preschool practitioners to engage in discussions about recent developments, challenges, and future directions. This initiative acts as a mechanism for improved accountability and systematic monitoring. In addition, 230 preschool educators built their capacity through training modules developed based on international best practices covering: positive parenting; inclusive pedagogy; disaster risk reduction; psychological first aid and trauma-informed practices with young children and their caregivers. In 10 preschool education facilities, expansion of learning spaces was initiated to expand access for refugee and host community children. Renovations integrated considerations related to access to clean water and energy efficiency.1,500 preschool educators have benefited from state-supported continuous professional development, while 26 educators have received formal qualifications, with these processes continuing to evolve. In collaboration with UNICEF, new training modules focusing on positive parenting and psychological/psychosocial first aid have been developed and submitted to the MoESCS for integration into these professional development programs. 360 children aged 5-6 from refugee and other vulnerable families, including children with disabilities/developmental delays benefited from a one-month course implemented in 20 schools, to reach the state-defined standards necessary for successfully mastering the school curriculum. The related education package developed by UNICEF in collaboration with MoESCS and CSOs, is considered for potential expansion to help prepare more children without preschool experience for school entry.""Let’s Play Activity Cards - Play-Based Activities for Healing and Learning"" originally created by International Step by Step Association (ISSA) have been translated, adapted and introduced for caregivers and parents by UNICEF and a national CSO. The cards contain a set of play-based activities that help reduce stress, strengthen family bonds, and provide children with safety and comfort. Through various types of play, around 5685 children from target 20 preschools had an opportunity to express their feelings, heal, and continue learning about their world.","594000","389198","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

The gradual integration will foster a more sustainable and widespread impact on educational practices.UNESCO's collaboration with the National Academy of Education in conducting an anti-discrimination and gender-oriented examination of educational materials represents a significant commitment to fostering inclusive and equitable education. The presentation of analysis results in April 2024 will mark a pivotal moment in advocating for positive change, and the subsequent integration of recommendations into curricula and teaching methods will contribute to creating a more enlightened and inclusive educational environment. This initiative aligns with UNESCO's broader mission to advance education for sustainable development and social progress.    ","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
