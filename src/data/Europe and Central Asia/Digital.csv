To achieve this, the country has established a comprehensive National Plan for Advancing Gender Equality, rooted in the Beijing Platform for Action. Montenegro is unwavering in its commitment to execute this plan effectively and to further enhance its domestic legislation on gender equality, thus guaranteeing women's complete involvement in decision-making processes. Moreover, Montenegro is actively engaged in ongoing efforts to raise awareness and conduct educational campaigns aimed at ending violence against women, which includes the active participation of men and boys. At the inception of the project, a gender analysis of the situation in the country will be conducted. The project aims at encouraging women and youth to participate in the project activities, and to ensure that women and men, as well as persons with disabilities, equally benefit from capacity building and other activities wherever possible. The project will also benefit from the equal participation of women and men in both project management and as beneficiaries, partners and key stakeholders of the project. The project management team will also strive to encourage gender parity in planning the project activities and will ensure that recommendations and policy reviews prepared during the project implementation will be gender-responsive, and liaison with sector-specific women’s business associations and civil society groups working on the intersection of gender, digital transformation and AI will be established. In compliance with the UNIDO Gender Mainstreaming Guidelines, project personnel will take the basic “I Know Gender” online course in the UN Women e-Learning Campus (https://trainingcentre.unwomen.org) for learning and promoting relevant issues. Further, all advocacy materials and other communication activities will use gender-inclusive language and gender-balanced representation as well as not use images/descriptions that would reinforce gender stereotypes. The Gender digital divide is considered for project activities. Specific challenges for women to access and adopt frontier technologies will be addressed and raised whenever possible. It should be noted that statistics for university graduates show that women are better educated in Montenegro than men. However, employment statistics show much lower figures in active employment7. Against this background, the project will ensure that female participation is actively promoted, particularly when it comes to identifying pilot companies to use the technologies for digitalizing cultural heritage Providing innovative, cutting-edge technologies specifically to female entrepreneurs could have a positive reinforcement effect, so any criteria for selection will specifically consider companies with higher percentages of female employment, and encourage others to target women in their activities for cultural heritage. Further the project will collect sex-disaggregated data, whenever feasible, and advocate the inclusion of women-run/-owned enterprises for pilot activities when companies are involved. A preliminary target is set of at least 30% of women-owned and women-led firms to be involved as project beneficiaries, which can be considered a gender-transformative measure given the low ratio of women entrepreneurs in this field as reported in 2021, 31.34 % of entrepreneurs in Montenegro are women. The project will consider setting target for women’s participation in capacity-building activities of at least 40%.

These villages will serve as the pilot areas for REU’s first Digital Village Initiative interventions based on ‘village-twinning’ and other transformational activities such as enhancing digital literacy and access to markets, delivering digital rural services (advisory and information services, early warnings, e-subsidies, etc), as well as financial and insurance services; promoting digital rural champions and digital farm labs models, etc. Ultimately, FAO will support the local stakeholders to develop project proposals to mobilize the necessary resources to further accelerate villages’ digital transformation.

Telemedicine can facilitate universal access to a sustainable primary healthcare system, regardless of location, and at minimal cost, utilizing digital solutions to bridge the healthcare gap for the most vulnerable communities.The programme has provided medical furniture and devices, medical supplies, and training on the usage and maintenance of equipment to ambulatory doctors across 55 municipalities in Georgia. The continued support provided to medical personnel in enhancing surveillance, data management, and contact tracing capabilities, including through the implementation of the outbreak investigation tool Go.Data, for field data collection during public health emergencies. Prioritizing critical infrastructure, the country's digital transformation has enabled patients to consult with healthcare providers and raise their awareness about health-related issues from their own homes. This advancement allows doctors to prescribe medicines, obtain additional expertise, enter immunization data, conduct ante-natal care consultations with expectant mothers, and compile reports.Regular virtual check-ins with nurses, doctors and specialists help monitor chronic conditions, identify potential health concerns early, and ensure that patients receive effective ongoing care.In this project, the WHO has formulated telemedicine clinical guidance and care pathways, outlining the requirements for running teleconsultation services associated with priority non-communicable diseases. Rural doctors are also being trained to conduct online consultations using digital medical devices, resulting in advanced competencies in telemedicine and increased skills in using digital solutions.UNFPAAs a result of UNFPA efforts, in 2023 UNFPA collaboration with MoH IT Agency and the NCDC supported introduction of new service delivery approaches such as telemedicine in the SRH field, specifically in Antenatal Care (ANC) and Family Planning: (a) MoH adjusted the state ANC program to accommodate telemedicine approaches in service provision; (b) An online training module on remote delivery of ANC services has been developed and embedded into the Medical University’ Continuous Medical Education system; (c) an alternative online registration module for the planned antenatal care visits for women residing in remote areas developed; (d) an e-book for pregnant women and E-modules for parents’ classes were developed; (e) online registration module for cervical cancer screening programme was introduced countrywide resulting in over 28,300 booked visits.","1668843","1668843","710843","As a result of UNFPA efforts, in 2023 UNFPA collaboration with MoH IT Agency and the NCDC supported introduction of new service delivery approaches such as telemedicine in the SRH field, specifically in Antenatal Care (ANC): (a) MoH adjusted the state ANC program to accommodate telemedicine approaches in service provision; (b) An online training module on remote delivery of ANC services has been developed and embedded into the Medical University’ Continuous Medical Education system; (b) an alternative online registration module for the planned antenatal care visits for women residing in remote areas developed; (c) an e-book for pregnant women and E-modules for parents’ classes were developed; (d) online registration module for cervical cancer screening programme was introduced countrywide resulting in over 28,300 booked visits.WHO: All the devices delivered and distributed; Behavioral and Cultural Insight (BCI) study finalized; training modules under development; Digital health strategy and payment model for telemedicine services under development.","720000","420000","","-","","","","-","","","","-"

Joint work allowed to align the Concept with international guidelines and better define the strategic directions, mechanisms, and conditions for the formation of universal competencies of children and young people at different levels of education. The Concept embraced the general framework of the universal 21st century competencies developed within Belarus educational system, with a particular focus on social-emotional skills (SES). Based on the Concept, an Action Plan to build SES in Children and Young People for 2023-2026 was drafted. The Action Plan clearly defined the main interventions and implementing partners for each block and was submitted to the MOE for endorsement.International expertise was highly appreciated by the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the Republican Institute of Professional Education (RIPE) during development of the SES ME tool comprising 25 criteria and 94 indicators to measure 3 main SES components: emotional regulation, communication, and cooperation. The ME tool was co-created with adolescents from technical vocational colleges who provided recommendations and feedback. The tool will be piloted in 2024.To ensure the quality and sustainability of the SES integration in the education process the SES normative framework was supplemented by development of an in-service training programme for general secondary and technical vocational education teachers and methodological recommendations for different groups (e.g. teachers, administrations, parents) on how to integrate SES in the education process in schools and colleges.The in-service training programme for pedagogues was complemented with a curriculum for an elective courses on advancement of social-emotional skills among 3-4th and 6th-7th grade students and trainer guide developed by the NIE.

This focus includes enhancing digital competencies and leveraging information technologies to improve digital literacy across various adult groups. In response to a request from the Ministry of Education and Research in 2021, the International Labour Organization (ILO) is supporting the promotion of digital literacy for adults (45-65) in rural areas, with a particular focus on low-skilled / low-educated populations, women and disadvantaged groups.The ILO project proposes a comprehensive assessment of digital literacy among the above-mentioned segments of the adult population in Moldova. The assessment will focus on digital skills, evaluating current competencies and identifying technological skill gaps that impact employment and employability of low-skilled and disadvantaged adults. The primary objective is to gauge digital skills in rural areas, identify gaps, and provide insights into technological skills necessary for improving employability for unemployed and disadvantaged populations.To effectively carry out this assessment and leverage the expertise required, the ILO signed a UN-to-UN agreement with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), (hereinafter ‘Implementing Partner’). This partnership will ensure access to ITU's specialized knowledge and resources in digital skills assessment, enhancing the quality and impact of the evaluation.The ITU will be responsible for designing the methodology for the assessment, conducting the assessment, and drafting a report, including recommendations. The assessment will serve as a catalyst for creating and implementing training programs that address skills needed for everyday activities, using digital government services, and improving employability, with a particular focus on gender-related needs and challenges.","","","","-","","","","-"

Triggered by a prolonged cold winter and heavy snowfall in the high mountain pastures of two districts in Naryn Province, 232 tons of prepositioned fodder were distributed by district authorities to 3,561 pastoralists. The provided fodder helped these pastoralists prevent mass livestock deaths and improve their ability to sustain livestock during harsh winter conditions. A revolving mechanism was established to replenish the distributed fodder in the warehouses, ensuring preparedness for the 2024-2025 winter season. WFP also continued to integrate the digital climate hazard monitoring system - Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM) - into the national disaster risk monitoring system, facilitating the government's strategic shift from recovery and response to prevention and mitigation of disaster risks. The digital system has been deployed on the server of the Ministry of Emergency Situations.WFP has been developing an Atlas of Mudflow Risk to identify the prevalence and vulnerability of the country's territories to mudflows in various areas. This Atlas can serve as the basis for the Ministry’s online platform for mudflow monitoring and forecasting within its disaster risk management system.

In parallel, industry organizations will have the capacity to leverage the Guidelines to establish safer and more secure services tailored for children. Simultaneously, parents and educators will gain valuable insights to assist them in recognizing potential threats and risks children might encounter online. This guidance will empower them to preempt and effectively address these challenges in a timely manner.2) In partnership with IT-Park Uzbekistan, the course materials ‘Information Security in Digital Education Space’, developed jointly by the ITU Regional Office for CIS and the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education, were successfully adapted to the national context and translated into Uzbek.

Moreover, online course has built-in accessibility features, that allow users with disabilities to successfully complete it. It consists of several modules covering the following topics: information security issues, basic legislation in the field of information technology and information protection, the relationship between the use of digital devices and children's mental health, organizing children's information security behavior in the digital space, cyber hygiene and cyber security for students, computer viruses and analysis of software products aimed at ensuring children's information security in the digital educational space. Upon successful completion of the course, each participant receives a certificate that attests to their accomplished training and signifies their capability to apply the acquired knowledge in their everyday undertakings.3) 305 teachers (275 men and 30 women) from 14 regions of Uzbekistan, affiliated with IT Parks and IT-Academies, were trained on information security during a series of offline trainings.

This system aims to improve vineyard management, support informed policymaking, and ensure quality assurance in winemaking. Through technical expertise and capacity-building efforts, FAO has facilitated the effective utilization of the VRS. The VRS Terms of Reference (ToR), developed by FAO, were revised to include scalability and multi-functionality based on feedback from the Ministry of Economy, external experts, and the Digitalization Council of Armenia. This collaborative effort ensured that the system could expand to other agricultural value chains. The Ministry launched the state procurement process based on FAO-prepared documentation, though delays in the procurement process have highlighted the need to adjust the project timelines to account for such challenges. FAO remains engaged in providing technical support, collaborating with vendors, building capacities, and amending policy frameworks to ensure successful project implementation. To accommodate the complexities of government procurement and ensure thorough development, the project timeline has been extended to the end of 2025. These efforts reflect FAO's dedication to promoting digital innovation and sustainable agricultural practices in Armenia.FAO was supporting the Ministry of Economy in developing the Law on Agriculture since 2021, working closely with the Deputy Minister to create the draft. After the initial submission of the full draft Agriculture Law package, FAO engaged in extensive revisions based on feedback from the Ministry of Economy (MoE) and other government agencies. A revised draft, along with responses to comments, was sent back to the MoE for further consideration. Additionally, partners such as the Austrian Development Agency, World Bank, and others expressed interest in collaborating with FAO in the development of the Law on Agriculture. FAO continues to provide ongoing support to finalize the draft.To improve state support mechanisms in Armenia, FAO assisted the Ministry of Economy with a study on EU best practices, offering a set of recommendations on subsidy schemes and relevant policies. A report with these recommendations for subsidy programs was developed and shared with the Government for review.","76126","76126","0","-","","","","-","","","","-"

To address the digital divide, UNDP in collaboration with Tekwill in Every School initiative established 5 additional digital labs across Moldova, enhancing education service provision and fostering digital learning in schools, and actively supported the integration of women and girls in science and technology, advocating for STEAM-based education. Collaborating closely with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, and Ministry of Culture, UNDP facilitated access to digital literacy through social workers and librarians, ensuring inclusivity in public services. UNDP efforts to modernize public services extended to introducing advanced solutions (MobiSign, MWallet – both in clearance stage) as a backbone for the future digital identity of the citizen for a seamless digital experience. By the end of the heating period, 895,000 households, representing 75% of Moldova's population (including refugees), registered on the EVRF digital platform compensatii.gov.md. This on-bill compensation digital service, supported by UNDP, contributed to the reduction of energy poverty by 43%. UNDP facilitated the use of data for evidence-driven policy formulation and decision-making. The successful experience with on-bill compensation for energy vulnerability serves as a role model for social vulnerability indexes under the social protection reform announced by the Government, while the digital map on road accidents will inform the upcoming road safety strategy.","1606085","1606085","1606085","In 2024, UNDP played a significant role in advancing Moldova's digital transformation agenda, driving efforts to improve public service delivery and support critical structural reforms. UNDP served as the primary development partner to the MLSP in the transformative digitalization of social protection. A new integrated digital architecture and a coherent roadmap were designed to address fragmentation and inefficiencies in services and programs, laying the foundation for more accessible, effective, and inclusive delivery. UNDP also collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture to secure approval for an institutional roadmap for the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in Moldova. This roadmap is expected to modernize agricultural administration processes and ensure compliance with EU standards. In addition, UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Energy to draft the Digital Transformation Strategy for theEnergy Sector for 2025-2032, which will set a strategic vision for digital innovation and efficient energy management in the coming years. To support local governance, UNDP introduced the Voluntary Amalgamation Online Simulator, enabling LPAs to evaluate amalgamation compliance, identify administrative centers, and estimate financial incentives. This tool promotes transparency, accessibility, and evidence-based decision-making in the amalgamation process. UNDP also made significant strides in localizing Moldova’s e-governance agenda, enhancing access to and efficiency of public services at the municipal level. As part of these efforts, the ""e-Cancelaria"" electronic document management system was implemented in Cahul and Ungheni, offering 17 public services and processing over 8,700 requests, evenly utilized by businesses (51%) and residents (49%). These initiatives have improved public service provision, fostered a more accessible and efficient governmental framework, and demonstrated UNDP’s commitment to creating a sustainable and inclusive digital ecosystem for Moldova.","500000","500000","","-","1000000","","","-","300000","","","-"

2. Mobile support team: Based on the capacity building activities, the creation of four mobile support teams to roll-out support to museum professionals across the country to digitize their inventory and document their objects.
3. Pilot Projects Implementation: Conducting a series of pilot projects to complete or develop selected inventories and to digitize individual data sets of movable cultural property, museum collections, historic archives, documents, and existing inventories (including intangible cultural heritage). The digitization process will address various scenarios:
a. Standardizing already digitized inventory cards/entries to provide centralized access to decentralized inventories.
b. Converting paper cards into digital data.
c. Undertaking full digitization where no pre-existing inventory records and collections exist.
The project not only aims to safeguard Ukraine's movable cultural properties during the ongoing war but also seeks to lay the groundwork for sustainable cultural heritage management. By digitizing and standardizing the inventory process, this initiative will enhance accessibility and interoperability with other governmental databases and align with international digital heritage standards.
