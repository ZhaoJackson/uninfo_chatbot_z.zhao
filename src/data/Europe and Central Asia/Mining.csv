","29033989","29033987","23675228","Key accomplishments include empowering responders, advancing inclusive growth, supporting victim assistance, and championing Ukrainian innovation. These efforts contributed to 20 activities under the National Mine Action Strategy for 2024–2033, with UNDP's technical expertise playing a significant role.The provision of equipment to 202 State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) demining teams boosted the operational capacity of national mine action efforts. MAP deployed 7 Non-Technical Survey (NTS) teams to survey 11.7 million m² of war-affected land, releasing 3.91 million m², benefitting 1,369 individuals in Chernihiv and Kharkiv oblasts, in communities with a population of 73,092.To enhance Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) capabilities, 16 National Police of Ukraine (NPU) specialists received training on Hook and Line (HL) systems. Additionally, 8 NPU and 2 SESU EOD specialists completed a joint HL training of trainers course. MAP also conducted underwater EOD training for 6 specialists with Lithuanian Anti-Terrorist Operations Unit 'ARAS.'Animal detection systems (ADS) progressed with the introduction of Technical Survey Dog (TSD) methodology in Ukraine. 8 women dog handlers were trained, deploying 12 TSDs for rapid land release. The second phase of unmanned technologies testing in humanitarian demining, focusing on sensors, drones, and AI to detect explosives, was completed with 7 Ukrainian companies involved. This testing will contribute to developing a unified standard for using unmanned technologies.UNDP’s report on innovative financing proposed mechanisms like Sustainability-Linked Bonds and Outcome-Based Public-Private Partnerships to address a $34.6 billion funding gap and align mine action with agriculture and renewable energy.A strengthened Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA) was established, training 58 Information Management Officers (IMOs), including 10 veterans with disabilities, in mapping, spatial analysis, and geospatial data management. This improved operational efficiency and informed decision-making for key Ukrainian institutions. Additionally, MAP is developing a debris removal system tailored for SESU, focusing on monitoring casualties from explosive remnants of war (ERW). A second training session for 12 veterans on mechanical demining provided practical knowledge on equipment, and 4 veterans secured jobs in humanitarian demining.MAP has made incremental progress in mainstreaming disability inclusiveness and advancing the UNDP Model of victim assistance in Ukraine. Trainings have strengthened the EO victim assistance system at both national and local levels. These include:•	Workshops on ""National Standards for Medical Support to Demining Operations,"" contributing to recommendations for national standards.•	15 healthcare professionals trained in advanced rehabilitation techniques for EO victims in Denmark.•	68 health professionals trained in Post-Amputation Mobility Aid (PPAM) for EO victims.•	415 professionals from NGOs, the Ministry of Social Policy (MoSP), and State Employment Services (SES) received training on social support services for EO victims and PWDs.•	167 local authorities and NGOs from Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, and Chernihiv oblasts participated in workshops to build local support networks for EO victims.•	92 local authorities from Kharkiv, Kherson, and Mykolaiv participated in a workshop on the new National Mine Action Strategy.•	24 NPU participants enhanced skills in service provision for people with impairments, including EO survivors, considering PWD protection and human rights in policing.•	25 psychologists from SESU received training on mental health and psychosocial support for war-affected populations, including EO victims.•	101 specialists trained in trauma-informed communication and service provision.•	81 social workers trained to provide quality social services to vulnerable communities, including EO victims.MAP also organized the TECH4Life Congress, showcasing innovative assistive technology, with over 350 in-person and 3,500 online participants.To ensure knowledge sharing in global forums, MAP secured the participation of 3 NMAA official, a representative from the MoEC, and a veteran who had completed IM training, in the Fifth Review Conference of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC) on a Mine-Free World, held in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

- Development of joint measures to prevent and respond to pollution of the Syr Darya river in emergencies (Phase i): The overall objective is to reduce and prevent pollution of the water resources of the transboundary Syr Darya river. Currently, the project is in Phase 1 of its implementation, which includes understanding disaster risks and identifying potential sources of accidental pollution (the inventory and hazard/risk map of tailings by the riparian countries is the part of this activity), managing disaster risks and strengthening preparedness for an effective response. 

- Addressing technological/industrial accident risks in national strategies and DRR plans of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan is supported with enriching its National DRR strategic documents, incl. its action plan with information on technological/industrial accident risk (within the context of the Industrial Accidents Convention, covering chemical installations as well as tailing management facilities (TMFs)), incl. in relation to Natech and transboundary cooperation).  It aims to set the scene for broader joint cooperation with UNDRR, joining forces in the pursuit of common policy objectives through project-related activities in CA. 

- Conducting an annual meeting of the National Policy Dialogue on water, and develop policy packages upon agreement (laws, studies, etc.).

The initiative commenced with an exploratory phase reaching out to many young people to identify the key areas of their interest and concern. Based on the data gathered with over 700 young people, a series of deep-dive consultations with youth from across the country were held on three distinct topics: Education, Environment and Climate change and Mental health and wellbeing. The recommendations arising from these discussions were incorporated in a Youth for Action Strategy aimed at policy makers. This Youth for Action Strategy was signed and backed by the President of North Macedonia, pledging to champion these calls on their behalf.

As previously reported, North Macedonia participated in the second Generation Unlimited Global Challenge and yet again produced one of the five global finalists. The eBionics team competed with their solution to expand access to prosthetic care with Venus Arm, an open-source 3D printed bionic arm for people with upper limb deficiency. In the months following the announcement of the winners, the team continued their work, this time with a dedicated implementing partner supporting them in following the incubation plan to further advance the idea. An initial pitch is scheduled for September 2021. Another notable success is one of the runners-up in the local competition. Working on the Walkiie application, the team “Something Atypical” received global recognition as one of the seven World Bank 2020 Ideas for Action Winners. The application is designed to connect friends, family, teachers or volunteers with people with disabilities, supporting them to pursue new activities or schedule specific tasks.","112000","111352","111352","In 2022 UNICEF managed to scale-up existing opportunities for youth participation and empowerment in their overall reach as well as impact. As a result of UNICEF supported venues and tools, young people in the country co-created three major national policies and strategies including: the National Transforming Education Commitment – as part of the Global Transforming Education Summit, the National Development Strategy 2022-2042, and the National Strategy for Prevention and Justice for Children. Young people were engaged through multiple live debates and consultations as well as through U-Report which has increased its base of U-Reporters threefold in this year alone (200 to 920). By the end of the year U-Report was once again used as the primary channel for youth engagement in co-creating and validating another key document - the new National Youth Strategy. These efforts are consolidating UNICEF’s role as the ‘go to agency’ on youth participation and empowerment, and youth’s input in these key documents ensures that their voice has real, tangible, impact.UNICEF supported programmes also placed young people in the position to develop new skills, innovate and implement solutions to challenges in their communities and the country. A total of 465[1] young people from diverse backgrounds (majority of which were girls) actively participated and developed 94[2] innovations and products through four major programmes: UPSHIFT, Generation Unlimited, Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and Justice for Children (J4C). In doing so, UNICEF actively supported the engagement of girls in STEM, equipping them with the necessary skills and attitudes for social innovation and entrepreneurship.During the reporting year, the UPSHIFT programme focused on youth-led solutions to environmental challenges in three areas: water, air, and energy. 150 young people participated in these thematic UPSHIFT cycles, implemented in partnership with the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development. Out of the 30 developed solutions, 15 received seed funding and were implemented in communities. Furthermore, for the first time a crowdfunding initiative was implemented by the young people themselves to complement the seed funding. Some of these solutions with minor adaptations have a great potential beyond the country. They are aimed to tackle water usage efficiency, energy conservancy and air pollution.The third Generation unlimited was implemented again in partnership with the Telekom Foundation for Macedonia. Over 127 young people applied with solutions to mitigate climate change effects and 40 of them participated in a three-day workshop to finalize and pitch their ideas. The best 5 solutions received seed funding and two competed in the Global challenge. Some of them include: an application that encourages users to reduce waste and promote a circular economy through swaps and trades; a soil bin for the household that makes best use of organic waste; and a smart trash bin that is sorting waste in preparation for recycling.","300000","50000","50000","A youth-led campaign against cyberviolence included 27 young people from across the country in a three-day workshop with mental health experts, and media professionals. The young people developed 20 social media reels and motioned graphic materials that reached more than 62.200 people on social media. Finally, a “Takeover the Assembly” event was organized on World Children’s Day, with 54 young people that took over a Parliament session opening discussion on three topics that they have identified themselves as the most important issues facing children and young people today.Youth participation in policy development through UNICEF supported venues and platforms was also very successful. In 2023 through U-Report and multiple other venues and events young people directly contributed to important legislation and strategies (National Strategy for Prevention and Justice for Children, National Youth Strategy, HPV and vaccination campaigns, Mental health and Violence against Children).","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-","","","","-"
