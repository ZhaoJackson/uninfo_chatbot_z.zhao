Below is a synthesis of four main areas where UN-supported work in Africa for 2024 can help address illicit financial flows (IFF) and transnational crimes, followed by key challenges or gaps:

1) Cross-Border Trade Governance (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
   • Illustration: The UN is raising awareness among cross-border traders about their rights and opportunities under ECOWAS and AfCFTA, including the use of obstacle alert systems for non-tariff measures. These efforts aim to encourage lawful trade and reduce vulnerabilities to illicit flows.

2) Migration Policy and Legal Frameworks (Theme: Governance & Rule of Law)  
   • Illustration: Through support for inclusive migration policies (e.g., Madagascar), the UN helps governments address complex migration realities. Strengthening policy coherence and legal frameworks reduces the risk of human trafficking and related cross-border crimes.

3) Strengthening Institutional & Legislative Capacity (Theme: Governance & Rule of Law)  
   • Illustration: The UN provides technical assistance for drafting and harmonizing laws, developing strategic plans, and training government institutions. This bolsters regulatory systems to detect, prevent, and prosecute transnational criminal activity more effectively.

4) Data & Monitoring Systems for Crime Detection (Theme: Institutional Capacity)  
   • Illustration: UN-supported initiatives improve real-time data collection and disaggregation, which helps authorities monitor and respond to illicit financial flows. By honing data-driven decision-making, governments become more adept at tracking suspicious activities across borders.

Challenges/Gaps:  
Continued gaps in institutional capacity, technological resources, and inter-agency coordination can hamper efforts to curb IFF and transnational crimes. Disparate data systems and limited cross-border collaboration may lead to inconsistent enforcement and oversight. Furthermore, under-resourcing of policy reforms and limited integration of gender and youth considerations in crime prevention efforts remain persistent hurdles.
