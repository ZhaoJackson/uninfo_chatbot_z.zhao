Below is a consolidated view of four main mining‐related focus areas found in the 2024 UN programming data, each labeled with a theme and briefly illustrated, followed by a summary of potential challenges/gaps.

1) Formalization and Regulation of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (Economic Empowerment)  
   • This includes activities to bring Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASMs) into legally recognized frameworks.  
   • The UN supports capacity building and policy measures so that miners can operate more safely, transparently, and profitably under national regulations.

2) Adoption of National Standards and Coordination for Mine Action (Health & Community Safety)  
   • Several initiatives focus on developing and implementing national guidelines to clear landmines and explosive remnants of war.  
   • This work also extends to local-level risk education and community outreach aimed at reducing casualties and promoting safe practices in affected areas.

3) Strengthening Governance and Concession Frameworks (Governance & Regulatory Strengthening)  
   • Efforts include clarifying concession periods, improving licensing processes, and ensuring that mining agreements are fair and transparent.  
   • Technical assistance is provided to reinforce institutions’ capacity to monitor and enforce regulations, fostering accountability in the sector.

4) Integrating Environmental Sustainability into Mining Policies (Climate Action & Environmental Protection)  
   • Support is provided to align mining‐sector development with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.  
   • Capacity building and policy reviews help ensure that mining activities uphold environmental standards and contribute to broader climate resilience goals.

Potential Challenges/Gaps (in 2–3 sentences):  
Limited regulatory capacity and uneven enforcement remain significant hurdles to effective formalization and compliance. Additionally, the sector often faces funding constraints and insufficient coordination among government agencies, which can slow down both demining efforts and responsible concession management. Finally, gaps in data, technical expertise, and community engagement can limit the impact of sustainability initiatives in the mining sector.
