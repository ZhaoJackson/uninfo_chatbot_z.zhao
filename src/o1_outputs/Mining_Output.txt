Below is a synthesis of the data through the lens of “mining” support in Africa, interpreted to cover both formalizing artisanal mining and addressing landmines (i.e., “mine action”):

1) Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASMs) in Jos  
   • Theme: Economic Empowerment  
   • Specific Focus: Helping small-scale miners enter the formal economy through capacity building and better regulatory frameworks. This involves introducing policies and training that safeguard labor rights while promoting sustainable resource extraction.

2) Community-Based Mine Risk Education and Clearance  
   • Theme: Peace and Security  
   • Specific Focus: Equipping local communities to identify and safely address landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Activities include awareness campaigns, mine/ERW risk education, and outreach to ensure civilian safety in post-conflict regions.

3) Development and Adoption of National Mine Action Standards  
   • Theme: Governance and Policy  
   • Specific Focus: Supporting governments to create or update national regulations and technical guidelines for mine clearance. This work improves coordination and ensures that demining efforts meet international standards and are carried out safely and effectively.

4) Integration of Mine Action into Community Resilience and Stabilization  
   • Theme: Community Resilience  
   • Specific Focus: Linking demining efforts to broader community initiatives aimed at rebuilding livelihoods and restoring basic services. This includes embedding humanitarian demining in projects that foster social cohesion, economic recovery, and local capacity strengthening.

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
A key challenge is ensuring sufficient funding and technical expertise for both the formalization of artisanal mining and large-scale demining operations, especially in remote or conflict-affected areas. Coordination can also be constrained by overlapping mandates among government agencies and limited data-sharing. In places where broader security risks persist, safe access for demining teams and effective oversight of artisanal mining remain significant hurdles.
