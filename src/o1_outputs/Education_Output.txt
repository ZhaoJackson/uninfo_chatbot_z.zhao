1) Improving Equitable Access to Quality Education (Theme: Education Access)  
   • UN support is focused on ensuring inclusive enrollment and retention across all levels—pre-primary, primary, and secondary—particularly for vulnerable groups (e.g., refugees, out-of-school children, girls).  
   • Efforts include Child Friendly Schools (CFS) frameworks, construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, and targeted campaigns to boost enrollment.  

2) Strengthening Skills Development and Economic Empowerment (Theme: Economic Empowerment)  
   • Projects emphasize equipping youth, women, and men with employable skills through both formal and non-formal education pathways (including STEM and vocational programs).  
   • Initiatives include accelerated learning programs, gender-responsive strategies for girls in STEM, and advocacy for increased budget allocations to education that can spur economic diversification.  

3) Mainstreaming Health and Social Well-Being in Education (Theme: Health Systems Integration)  
   • Climate change, comprehensive sexuality education, nutrition counseling, and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) are integrated into school curriculums and teacher trainings.  
   • Programs promote teenage pregnancy prevention, maternal and child health awareness, and climate-smart education to create safer, healthier learning environments.  

4) Enhancing Policy, Coordination, and Governance (Theme: Governance & Sector Coordination)  
   • Support is provided for the development and review of national education policies, strategic plans, sector analyses, and data systems to improve planning and oversight.  
   • This includes strengthening institutional capacities, stakeholder coordination, and domestic resource mobilization for sustained educational reforms.  

Potential Challenges/Gaps:  
Limited financial resources, especially in rural or crisis-affected regions, can hinder the expansion of equitable education services. Fragmented coordination among different stakeholders sometimes leads to overlapping efforts and gaps in policy implementation. Additionally, teacher shortages and lack of ongoing professional development constrain the quality of education delivery and limit the effectiveness of cross-cutting initiatives like climate education or comprehensive sexuality education.
