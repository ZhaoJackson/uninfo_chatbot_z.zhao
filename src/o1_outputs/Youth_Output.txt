1) Economic Empowerment:  
   • Emphasis on vocational training, entrepreneurship, and financial inclusion to help young people transition from school to work and create sustainable livelihoods.  
   • Includes support for agripreneurship, “cash for work” programs, and mentorship initiatives that link youth to markets, financing, and employment opportunities.

2) Education & Skills Development:  
   • Focus on expanding formal and non-formal education pathways (e.g., TVET, community-based learning) and strengthening educational quality and relevance.  
   • Includes efforts to reach out-of-school adolescents and youth with safe spaces, digital tools, and specialized training to better prepare them for decent work.

3) Health & Well-Being (including SRHR):  
   • Integrates youth-friendly health services, SRHR/HIV/GBV policies, and adolescent health interventions, ensuring accessibility and quality for marginalized groups.  
   • Involves building national health systems’ capacity to deliver equitable care and creating platforms for youth engagement in health policy and service design.

4) Governance, Peace & Social Cohesion:  
   • Builds youth leadership and participation in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, civic engagement, and electoral processes.  
   • Encourages collaboration with civil society and government institutions to ensure accountability, human rights protection, and inclusive policy-making at all levels.

Key Challenges/Gaps:  
Despite widespread commitments, limited resources and fragmented coordination across agencies often hamper the depth and reach of youth-focused initiatives. Cultural perceptions and restrictive norms can undermine youth participation and leadership. In conflict-affected contexts, political instability and security challenges further limit consistent engagement, especially among marginalized youth.
