Challenges/Gaps (2–3 Sentences):  
Persistent challenges include limited institutional capacity, fragmented coordination among partners, and insufficient funding to scale and sustain youth-focused interventions. Social and cultural barriers, combined with security risks in conflict-affected areas, may restrict the ability of young people—especially marginalized groups—to fully participate. Strengthening data collection and evidence-based planning remains crucial for closing gaps and ensuring programs more effectively reach youth.
