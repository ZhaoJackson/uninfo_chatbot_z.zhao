Below are four overarching digital focus areas in the UN’s 2024 country programming across Africa, together with the main theme and illustrative examples:

1) Economic Empowerment  
   • Focus: Programs enhancing digital financial inclusion, digital entrepreneurship, and market access for youth, women, small businesses, and farmers. For example, multiple initiatives aim to strengthen alternative digital lending, provide digital tools for farmers, and improve cross-border e-commerce to boost livelihoods.

2) Governance & Public Service Delivery  
   • Focus: Digitalization of government systems and citizen services—such as e-visa processes, e-justice, and participatory policy platforms—to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability. Illustrations include setting up digital feedback mechanisms for local planning, implementing online judicial data systems, and digital platforms to prevent corruption.

3) Health Systems  
   • Focus: Digitalizing health information systems and scaling innovations (e.g., for RMNCAH) to enhance patient care and data management. Activities include providing mobile digital equipment for clinics, building digital capacity in hospitals, and integrating new technologies to strengthen national health data collection and analysis.

4) Education & Skills Development  
   • Focus: Introducing digital tools and platforms in classrooms (e.g., NetXtudo) and vocational programs, and improving digital literacy among marginalized communities. Initiatives include supporting digital curricula at all education levels, upgrading teacher training with e-libraries, and fostering youth digital initiatives to improve employability.

Potential Challenges or Gaps:  
Common constraints include limited broadband infrastructure, unreliable electricity, and the high cost of devices in some regions, which can disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Gaps in digital literacy and weak policy or regulatory frameworks can hinder the sustainability of digital interventions. Ensuring equitable access—especially in rural areas and among vulnerable groups—remains a critical challenge for fully realizing the potential of these digital initiatives.
